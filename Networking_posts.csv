What was supposed to be a 1-hour interview turned into a 4-hour interview and they made me an offer the next week.  I expressed hesitancy, so they came back with a second offer that was 30% higher than their first offer, doubled the PTO, and slapped a ""Senior"" in front of the title.  I accepted it because even their baseline offer was more than I thought I was worth, and their second offer was just too bonkers to turn down.

But now I'm a couple months in here and I'm getting overwhelmed really really fast.  The few outages and major problems that came my way I was only able to resolve only through dumb luck and guessing, and most of my day is now spent trying to hide how little I actually know from my boss.  I get tasked with something, cheerfully say ""Okay sure, no problem!"" and then spend the next two days frantically googling and digging through Cisco's config docs to try and figure out how to pull this off.

So I'm trying my best to be less terrible at my job to justify this idiotic salary but fuck there's just so much.  I've started studying for my CCNP Switch exam and that's it's own deluge of info to try and absorb, but I also keep reading that being a CLI monkey is a dead end these days so in the evenings I'm slowly plowing through Learning Python the Hard Way.

But on top of the nuts-and-bolts networking I've also got to start figuring out this never ending stream of ancillary services, like I'm using SolarWinds for the first time and trying to understand why most of our alerts aren't sending emails even though it looks like they're being triggered, while I'm also living inside our Palo Alto firewalls for four hours a day trying to un-fuck the prior (now fired) outside security consultant's half-aborted attempt to implement segmentation with the firewalls at the network core, oh and also they paid a bunch of money for a Splunk server at some point which has it's own unique programming language that I need to sort (Hey Splunk, when your ""cheat sheet"" is a dozen pages long, it's not a cheat sheet) out so management can get the pretty graphs that drives their world, but I also need to learn how Microsoft's NPS/RADIUS server because that's the only thing we have for network access control and the policys are convoluted and completely undocumented and I'm terrified to touch it at all because it's a house of cards that will probably fall over the instant the wind blows the wrong way, and I'm keeping up with the daily VoIP management stuff on this expensive cloud provider they have (which is actually a small blessing because it's pretty straightforward compared to the CUCM clusters I'm accustomed to), oh and I'm sorting out Meraki for the first time too which has their own quirks (how the heck to you limit an SSID just to a specified Access Point?!).

And on top of this they're considering a company expansion in the next few months which would necessitate a near-complete re-architecture of the network with new Core/Distro switches to actually get 10gig fiber to all the access layer stacks, and new firewalls with much greater filtering capacity, and I've nodded and taken polite notes through meetings about these things and after I did some scary math and talked to VARs and finally went back to management and was like ""Guys, this is going to cost like half a million dollars"" and they all nodded and said ""Okay, that sounds about right, lets start seeing some high-level designs"" and I nod and smile while in my head I'm screaming WHAT THE FUCK I BARELY GOT MY CCNA WHY AM I HERE.

How the hell do you guys put up with this long term?  How can you possibly handle this never-ending firehose of stuff you're supposed to know, and be competent in?  How do you come in every day knowing that you're just one unplanned outage away from everyone knowing just how bad you are at this job?

I didn't mean for this to get any real attention.  I'd had a long day and banged it out just before taking the very long way home for a couple hours of motorcycle therapy.  This was just a rant/vent and yes, asking for some validation and support from people who've probably been here before.

Part of the shock is I came from a very large quasi-government enterprise with ~15,000 users where I was in a Junior roll on the network team and barely allowed to even make submissions into our CCB process, and now at this job I'm the *only* network guy for a company of 200 users.  So I have much more control, but also a much wider area of responsibility and it's been jarring to come to grips with it.

And while I do acknowledge that I'm not actually that bad at the job, there's still SO MUCH more I need to learn in terms of all the ancillary systems.

I had originally created it as an addon to Netbox, where it would pull the network device inventory via API, but decided against it for a few reasons.

I'm currently using it to manage my Cisco Nexus and Catalyst switches, routers, and ASA's.  (NX-OS, IOS, IOS-XE, and ASA).  There are some minor bugs here and there, but it's still something I've been working on actively for 2-3 months now.

Disclaimer:  I've seen Netbox posted here a while ago, after the author wrote his own DCIM system after not finding one he liked, so I was inspired to do the same.  You'll see some similarities in the formatting and layout.  All of the code is written from scratch, but I liked the layout in Netbox so much I used it as inspiration.

hbe5is,networking,1592485273.0,"# What is Wi-Fi? Where did it come from?

Wi-Fi is a brand name for wireless networking standards. Wi-Fi lets devices communicate by sending and receiving radio waves.

In 1971, the University of Hawaii demonstrated the first wireless data network, known as [ALOHAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet). In 1985, the US FCC opened the [ISM radio bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) for unlicensed transmissions. After 1985, other countries followed, and more people started experimenting. In 1997 and 1999, the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) ratified the first international wireless networking standards. They were called 802.11-1997, 802.11b, and 802.11a. The technology was amazing, but the names were not.

In 1999, the brand-consulting firm Interbrand created the logo and suggested Wi-Fi as the name. Wi-Fi was a pun on hi-fi, referring to high-fidelity audio. Wi-Fi was easier to remember than 802.11, and we've been stuck with the name since. The official name is Wi-Fi, but most people don’t capitalize it or include the hyphen. Wi-Fi, WiFi, Wifi, wifi, and [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) all refer to the same thing. In the early days, Wi-Fi was used as shorthand for Wireless Fidelity, but it isn’t officially short for anything. According to the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance), Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi.

# What does Wi-Fi do? How does Wi-Fi work?

Wi-Fi transmits data using microwaves, which are high-frequency radio waves. Wi-Fi is more complicated than FM radio, but the basic underlying technology is the same. They both encode information into radio waves, which are received and decoded. FM radio does this for sound, Wi-Fi does this for computer data. So how can we use radio waves to send sound, or information?

At a basic level, you can think of two people holding a jump rope. One person raises and lowers their arm quickly, creating a wave. With Wi-Fi, this person would represent your Wi-Fi router, or [wireless access point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point). Keeping the same up and down motion is known as a [carrier wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_wave). The person on the other end is the client device, such as a laptop or cell phone. When a wireless client joins the network and senses the carrier wave, it starts listening and waits for small differences in the signal.

In our example, you can imagine feeling the jump rope going up and down, and then receiving a single motion to the right. That single motion to the right can be interpreted as a [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) number 1. A motion to the left would be a binary 0. Chain enough 1’s and 0’s together and you can represent complicated things, like all the data on this webpage.

It sounds like [magic](https://www.evanmccann.net/blog/home-network-tips), but it’s not only Wi-Fi that works this way. Bluetooth, 4G, 5G, and most wireless transmissions work by manipulating waves to transfer electrical signals through the air. A deeper, better question than “How does Wi-Fi work?” is “How do wireless transmissions work?”

If you want a better answer, you need to have a basic understanding of a few things:

* Fundamental physics of electricity and magnetism
* Electromagnetic radiation, radio waves, and antennas
* How wired networks transmit data

I tried my best to keep this understandable, and laid out in a way that makes sense. This stuff is complicated, and hard to explain. That is why there are so many bad explanations of how Wi-Fi works out there.

This isn't going to be a light and breezy discussion. Each of these topics could be an entire college course, so forgive me for simplifying where possible. Use Wikipedia and other resources to fill in the gaps, or to clarify something I glossed over. As always, corrections and feedback are welcomed.

Let’s dive in the deep end and cover the physics first. If you’re not familiar with fundamental physics, Wikipedia is an amazing resource. The key terms highlighted in blue are links to Wikipedia articles which explain further.

# Wi-Fi Physics 101: Electricity and Magnetism

* [Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) is made up of atoms.
* [Atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) are made up of smaller particles: Negatively charged [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron), positively charged [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton), and neutral [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron).
* A positively or negatively charged particle creates an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field).
* An electric field exerts force on other charges around it, attracting or repelling them.
* [Magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) and electric fields are related. They are both results of the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism), one of the four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction) of nature.
* [Electrical current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) is a flow of negatively charged electrons through a conductive material, like a wire.
* Electrical current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field. This is how [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet) work.
* In 1867, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell) discovered that light, magnetism, and electricity are related.
* He predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves.
* His equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and other field changes.
* This is known as the 2nd great [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(physics)) of physics, behind Sir Issac Newton.
* In 1887, [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz) was the first to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves. People thought that was so cool, they used his last name as the unit for a wave’s frequency.
* [Electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) don’t need a medium. They can move through the vacuum of space, for example.
* Since visible light is an electromagnetic wave, this is how we can see the sun, or distant stars.
* This is also how we heard Neil Armstrong say “One small step for man…” live from the moon.
* The warmth you feel from sunlight is due to the [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy) sunlight contains. All electromagnetic waves have radiant energy.
* Examples of electromagnetic waves: Visible light, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
* Wi-Fi is an example of a [radio wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave), specifically a [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave). Microwaves are high-energy radio waves.

# Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves come in a wide range of forms. The type of wave is categorized by wavelength and frequency.

Wavelength is a measure of the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. In a typical [continuous sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) like Wi-Fi, every time a wave goes from peak to valley to peak, we call that a cycle. The distance it takes to complete one cycle is its wavelength.

Frequency is a measure of how many cycles the wave makes per second. We use Hertz (Hz) as the measure of frequency, 1 Hz is one cycle per second. The more common MHz and GHz are for millions, or billions, of cycles per second.

Imagine waves on a beach. On calm days the waves are small, and come in slowly. On a windy day the waves have more energy, come in faster, and have less distance between them. Higher energy, higher frequency, shorter wavelength. Unlike ocean waves, electromagnetic waves move at the speed of light. Since their speed is constant, their wavelength and frequency are inverse. As wavelength goes up, frequency does down. If you multiply the wavelength and frequency, you will always get the same value — the speed of light, the speed limit of the universe.

You can graph all the various kinds of electromagnetic waves, with the lowest energy on the left, and the highest energy on the right. We call this the electromagnetic spectrum. I’m not going to cover the entire electromagnetic spectrum, since we are mainly interested in Wi-Fi’s microwaves, and how we can use them to send data wirelessly.

Starting from the left, we have the low-energy waves we call radio. Opinions vary, but I’m going with Wikipedia’s broad definition that radio waves cover from 30 Hz, up to 300 GHz. Compared to the rest of the spectrum, radio’s wavelengths are long, their frequency is slow, and energy is low. Within radio waves, there is a separate category we call microwaves.

Microwaves fall within the broader radio wave range. At a minimum, microwaves cover 3 GHz to 30 GHz, but some people say microwaves extend further than that. The specific range depends on who you ask, but generally you can think of Microwaves as high-frequency radio waves.

Microwaves are used in microwave ovens, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, your cell phone’s 4G or 5G connection, and lots of other wireless data transmissions. Their higher energy, shorter wavelength, and other properties make them better for high-bandwidth transfers than traditional, lower-powered radio waves.

All waves can be modulated by varying either the amplitude (strength), frequency or [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)) of the wave. This is what allows Wi-Fi, and any other wireless technology, to encode data in a wireless signal.

# Wired Networking Transmissions

Before we cover how wireless data transmission works, we need to understand how wired data transmission works. In wired Ethernet networks, we use the copper inside Ethernet cables to transmit electrical signals. The conductive copper transfers the electrical current applied at one end, through the wire, to the other side.

A typical example would be a PC plugged into an Ethernet switch. If the PC wants to transfer information, it converts binary digits to electrical impulses. On, off, on, off. It sends a specific pattern of 1’s and 0’s across the wire, which is received on the other end. Ethernet is the neighborhood street of the networking world. It's great for getting around the local area, but you’ll need to jump on the highway if you want to go further.

The highway of the networking world is fiber optic cabling. Just like how Ethernet transfers electrical current, we can do the same thing with lasers and fiber optic cables. Fiber optic cables are made of bendable glass, and they provide a path for light to be transmitted. Since fiber optics require lasers, special transceivers are required at each end. Compared to Ethernet, Fiber optic cables have the advantage of having a longer range, and generally a higher capacity.

Fiber optic cabling carries a big portion of global Internet traffic. We have a wide array of fiber optic cabling over land, and sea. Those connections are what allow you to communicate with someone on the other side of the country, or the other side of the world. This is possible because these transmissions happen at the speed of light.

Here’s where things get fun. Just like how Ethernet and fiber optic cabling take an electrical impulse or beam of light from A to B, we can do the same thing with radios, antennas, and radio waves.

# Radios, Antennas, and Wireless Networking

Now that we have a rough common understanding of electromagnetic waves and wired data transmission, how can we transmit data wirelessly? The key is an antenna. [Antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)) convert electricity into radio waves, and radio waves into electricity. A basic antenna consists of two metal rods connected to a receiver or transmitter.

When transmitting, a radio supplies an alternating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the energy as electromagnetic waves. When receiving, an antenna reverses this process. It intercepts some of the power of a radio wave to produce an electrical current, which is applied to a receiver, and amplified. Receiving antennas capture a fraction of the original signal, which is why distance, antenna design, and amplification are important for a successful wireless transmission.

If you have a properly tuned, powerful antenna, you can send a signal 1000s of kilometers away, or even into space. It's not just Wi-Fi, this is what makes satellites, radar, radio, and broadcast TV transmissions work too. Pretty cool, right?

# How Wi-Fi Works: From Electricity to Information

* An intricate pattern of electrons representing computer data flow into your Wi-Fi router, or wireless access point.
* The access point sends that pattern of electrons to an antenna, generating an electromagnetic wave.
* By alternating between a positive to negative charge, the wire inside of an antenna creates an oscillating electric and magnetic field. These oscillating fields propagate out into space as electromagnetic waves, and are able to be received by anyone in range.
* Typical Wi-Fi access points have omnidirectional antennas, which make the wave propagate in all horizontal directions.
* This wave travels through the air and hits a receiving antenna which reverses the process, converting the radiant energy in the radio wave back into electricity.
* The electric field of the incoming wave pushes electrons back and forth in the antenna, creating an alternating positive and negative charge. The oscillating field induces voltage and current, which flows to the receiver.
* The signal is amplified and received, either to the client device or to an Ethernet connection for further routing.
* A lot of the wave’s energy is lost along the way.
* If the transmission was successful, the electrical impulses should be a good copy of what was sent.
* If the transmission wasn’t successful, the data is resent.
* When the information is received on the other end, it is treated the same as any other data on the network.

# More Fun Wi-Fi Facts

* Wi-Fi has redundancy built-in. If you wanted to send “Hello” your access point wouldn't send an H, an E, an L, an L and a O. It sends multiple characters for each one, just like you would on a static-filled radio or phone call. It will use its equivalent of the phonetic alphabet to send “Hotel”, “Echo”, “Lima”, “Lima”, “Oscar”.
* That way, even if you didn’t hear the entire transmission, you are still likely to be able to know that “Hello” was being sent. The level of redundancy varies on signal strength and interference on the channel.
* If the signal strength is high, the access point and receiver are able to use a complicated modulation scheme, and encode a lot of data.
* If you think about our jump rope analogy from earlier, rather than just left and right, it can divide into 1/4s, 1/8ths, or further. It can also combine the direction of the modulation with strength, or phase of modulation.
* The most complex modulation in Wi-Fi 6 is [1024-QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation), which has 1024 unique combinations of amplitude and phase. This results in high throughput, but requires a very strong wireless signal and minimal interference to work effectively.
* As your wireless signal weakens, complex modulation can’t be understood. Both devices will step down to a less complex modulation scheme. This is why Wi-Fi slows down as you move away from the access point.

# First In a Series: Wi-Fi 101

I plan on writing a whole series of posts about Wi-Fi fundamentals which  will cover various topics about Wi-Fi, how to improve your home  network, and related issues. If there is something you want me to cover,  leave a comment below.

## Footnotes

1. **The IEEE, an international standards body, sets the definitions of what Wi-Fi is.** They’re the reason we have Wi-Fi standards with names like 802.11n, 802.11ac or 802.11ax. They’ve since renamed the major standards to Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. With each generation, Wi-Fi gets better, and there are a lot of details to cover. I’ll cover that in a future post.
2. **Hertz did not realize the practical importance of his experiments.** ""It's of no use whatsoever. This is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there."" When asked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied, ""Nothing, I guess.""You can pay your respects to this legend by always capitalizing the H in MHz and GHz.
3. **It takes about one second for a radio wave to travel from the Earth to the moon.** It’s pretty amazing that over 50 years ago we had the technology to capture sound and images on the moon, turn them into electromagnetic waves, beam them back to Earth, and transmit them around the globe. I guess it’s pretty cool we put a human on the moon, too.
4. **If you keep adding energy to microwaves, you can end up in a unique part of the EM spectrum, visible light.** Visible light’s wavelengths are measured in nanometers, and nanometers are really small: a human hair is around 75,000 nanometers wide. Visible light has a wavelength between 380 and 740 nanometers and a frequency between 405 and 790 THz (trillions of cycles per second). It’s hard to wrap your head around, but a lot of foundational physics is, too.
5. Your eye is reading this page because your computer screen is sending out electromagnetic radiation in the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Differences in the wavelength cause your eye to interpret different areas of the page as different colors. A whole lot of brain magic and pattern recognition lets you interpret those color variations as letters and words. If I did my job as a writer, there should also be some *meaning* behind those words. All from some waves shooting out of your screen. Physics is amazing, [Wi-Fi isn't magic](https://www.evanmccann.net/blog/home-network-tips), and [writing is telepathy](https://www.evanmccann.net/blog/writing-is-telepathy).

NetConfig is built on Ubuntu 16.04 Server Edition.  I haven't tested this on other OS's.  Install instructions can be found in INSTALL.txt.  I've run through these a few times from a fresh Ubuntu install, and it works well, so let me know if you run into issues.

**What NetConfig is**

This was originally written as a graphical overlay for my existing Python scripts, and just kept growing.  It is built on Flask and Python 2.7, uses HTML and JavaScript on the front end, and Bootstrap for formatting.

It is built specifically for Cisco switches, routers, and firewalls, which use IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, or ASA platforms.  It will work with any other systems.  Since my existing devices I use do not have API support, all real-time data is pulled via SSH and Netmiko.  As such, I'm sure there will be formatting bugs and layout issues with other devices.  Feel free to post issues or fixes on Github.

**What NetConfig is not**

This is not an automation or error checking tool.  It may evolve into one later on, but not yet.

I plan to work on documentation in the next couple of weeks, as right now there isn't any.  In the meantime, please reference the README.txt to get started.

**New Features since last week**

1. I had a few requests for Netbox support, since many people (myself included) use Netbox as their DCIM source of truth.  *NetConfig now supports using Netbox to pull device inventory.*  
 Note: please read the instructions in NETBOX-INTEGRATION.txt carefully, as there are some custom fields that need to be set in Netbox to work properly with NetConfig.
2. NetConfig supports a local database file to store device names IP's, and device types.  *NetConfig now supports multiple device importing using CSV formatting.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/7huh5p/last_week_i_shared_screenshots_of_a_gui_overlay_i/,"Last week I shared screenshots of a GUI overlay I wrote for my non-API Cisco gear. It's now available on Github. I proudly present, NetConfig",,856,140,0.97

I'm sure there are others.  Please share if you have something that is not part of a normal CCNA /CCNP training... but makes your life easier anyway.

* Config terminal revert timer 20 - Make changes to to the config, but revert back in 20 minutes if I do not confirm.  I use this so I don't lock myself out of a switch from time to time....
* show ip device tracker or show device-tracker bindings - I will use this on an access switch to find the IP address of the device that is connected to a port.
* test cable-diagnostics tdr interface .... - Use to do simple cable diagnostics i.e. length of cable pairs.  Are they open or shorted.
* alias exec hardening version 8.2 -  09SEP2020 - I will use this as a way to making notes in the running config.  This would tell me that I applied a hardening script to the device, version 8.2, that was created on 09SEP2020.  This gives us an idea of what the enable password might be on a switch that has been offline for a while.  I'll also have Solarwinds flag switches that don't have the latest verision in the alias exec  note...
* define interface-range

define interface-range trunking gig 1/1/1

define interface-range users gig 1/0/1 - 24

I will use the define interface-range in the active switch config so that I can make scripts for trunking ports and users ports and apply it to different switch models.  Some models are 24 port.  Some are 48.  Some have trunking on TenGig ports.  Some  have it on Gig ports.

**TL;DR:** Learn how wavelength, core size, modal bandwidth, a few colors, and such affect fiber and you'll never have to worry about it.

----
**Fiber Cabling**

Fiber comes in 3 flavors:

* 62.5 micron (the diameter of the glass core).
* 50 micron
* 8, 9, or 10 micron

You'll see notations 62.5um (micrometer) because the symbol for micro is essentially a u.  I don't know how to get a micro-symbol from a normal keyboard and I'm not about to spend time trying to find out.

----
**Multi-mode Fiber**

Both 62.5 and 50 are called ""multi-mode"" but it's actually a combination of the fiber and the laser that determines whether (and how much) modal dispersion occurs.  However, the standards have lined up in a certain way that things (jacks, optics, etc) are called multimode or singlemode whether it applies to it or not, and I'll explain all that.

62.5 micron (sometimes, and technically is 62.5/125 because 125 is the cladding thickness) is mostly obsolete, but you still see it a lot.  62.5 micron comes in the following standards:

* FDDI (pronounced ""fiddy"") is an old networking standard (155mbps) developed by IBM.  It's essentially high-speed token-ring.  This was probably the first use of fiber for networking.
* OM1 -- modern 62.5 multi-mode fiber.

There's a good comparison over on the wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber#Comparison) that gives you limits, which is entirely related to speed and distance.

OM2, 3 and 4 standards are all 50 micron fibers and relate are used for 10G and higher speeds in data center applications.  See the wiki article above.
 
What defines these standards is a spec of the glass called *modal bandwidth*.  It's a very long explanation on what that is and how it relates to things, and has even weirder units (MHz/km).  I'm mentioning this here because you're going to see it later.  It's a number, bigger the better, and it's different for different wavelengths of light.  Basically there's handful of semi-standards between them that you'll see, so you'll need to know the modal bandwidth of your fiber and wavelength you want to use.

**Colors:**

62.5 fiber is usually orange in color (FDDI and OM1).
---
50 micron non-laser-optimized OM2 is orange as well, because someone was drunk that day.
---
50 micron fiber is typically aqua--at least what you see these days (OM3)
---
50 micron OM4 is violet (this is the latest shit, 40gig datacenter applications)
---
single-mode fiber is typically yellow
---
This is for patch cables and indoor cabling.  Outdoor cabling is black.  Inside cable bundles, each strand has a color and the color order is standard, not unlike, say, the color order in UTP.

The actual breakdown is as follows:

* FDDI (62.5um): Orange
* OM1 (62.5um): Orange, (Slate in military usage)
* OM2 (50um): Orange
* OM3 (50um ""laser optimized): Aqua
* OM4 (50um): Violet, although some Aqua
* Single Mode: Yellow

----
**Single-mode fiber**

8, 9 or 10 micron fiber (9 is the most common), also has a 125 micron cladding (so you'll see things like 9/125)  is called single-mode fiber and is typically yellow.  This actually comes in a couple different flavors, but you'll probably never need to care about them.  The primary standard is called SM1.  There's an SM2 and (I think) a 3 as well.  More correctly though it's called G.652, and there's some variations and other standards.  These are put out by the ITU, and here's the doc about [single-mode fiber selection](http://www.thefoa.org/tech/SM%20fibre%20selection.pdf) WARNING PDF and complicated, wait until you get through this to read that.

What you actually want is G.652.C or .D (revisions), but only comes into play when you need to care, and you probably don't.  (Certain wavelengths in WDM applications don't work well on some singlemode fiber).

----
**Connector colors**

Next, you have your end colors.  This actually defines how the glass at the end of the **ferrule** is polished.  They are:

* PC -- stands for Polished Connector (because you used to have to polish the ends under a magnifying glass before you could use it).  They're beige, and used for all multi-mode applications.
* UPC -- stands for Ultra Polished Connector.  They're blue.  This is what you see on single mode.
* APC -- Angled Polished connector.  They're green.  **These are quite uncommon.**  Used in things like GPON (gee-pawn) and some video applications.  Unplugged fiber reflects, and the angle that this is polished at reduces that.  In GPON (for example), the same light is sent to multiple destinations (homes typically) and if it's unplugged at one home, the reflection will horse up the reception of the light at the other homes.

Couple things to know about APC:  If you plug an APC cable into something that's not designed for APC, you can crush the glass sticking out of the conenctor and/or damage the device you're plugging it into.

----

**Brief review**

1. You find an orange patch cable with beige ends.  It reads *62.5/125/OM1* on the side of it.  This is a modern 62.5 cable.
2. You find a grey patch cable with beige ends.  You know it's multi-mode, but you'll have to read it to find out what kind.  All it says is OM3, so you know it's a 50 micron fiber.
3. You open a fiber termination box and see blue ends, you know it's single-mode fiber.
4. At your buddies house with his shiny new fiber connection, you see a yellow cable with a green end on it.  If you break it and have to replace it, you'll need a single-mode APC cable to do it.
5. Your buddy is about to plug a cable with a green end on it into a switch. He's about to fuck up the optic and the cable.

----

**End Types**

The form factor of the connector ends have names.  Common ones are:

* ST -- Stick and Twist (it's similar to BNC).  It's actually ST/BFOC and stands for Straight Tip Bayonette Fiber Optic Connector.
* LC -- Little connector (it's small).  Actually stands for Lucent Connector (they developed it).
* SC -- Square connector.  That's actually what it stands for, though there's some disagreement on that.
* MPO -- Multiple-fiber Push On.  A multi-fiber cable to for 40 and 100gig, also simplifies fiber runs, allows for things like break-out applications (a single 40gig optic to 4 10gig optics) and other things. MTP, which it is also called, is a brand of connector that complies with the MPO standard.  Thanks /u/Xipher.

Some other's you'll see from time to time:

* FC -- Ferrule conenctor (screws on like F connectors ala cable tv).  Dust proof, used for high vibration environments
* MTRJ -- Obsolete but I still run into it from time to time.

Here's a rundown on almost all of them over at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber_connector#Types).  Go there for pictures.

----

**Optics**

The things that go in switches and routers are called *optics*. **Don't fucking call it a GBIC Scott!** Seriously, that guy comes in my office all the fucking time asking for the GBIC going on xyz circuit.  GBIC is a form-factor, not a generic term for an optic--plus our circuits are SFP, SFP+ or X2.  These are specified by what are called MSA's (multi-source agreements) which is basically an industry agreement on standards.

Common ones are:

* GBIC -- pronounced ghee-bic (like Bic, the pen company).  Old Cisco standard.  Stands for gigabit interface converter.  It's gigabit, obviously.  Has an SC connector on it.
* SFP -- Small form factor pluggable.  This is the most common one you'll see these days in gigabit.  Has an LC connector on it.  Some people call these ""mini-GBICs"".  Those people are idiots.
* XENPAK -- an older 10G form factor, mostly obsolete. SC connector
* X2 -- smaller but electrically identical to XENPAK5.  SC connector.
* XPAK -- same idea as X2 (different from X2, but basically a smaller form factor XENPAK).  Can have LC or SC connectors.  Some even accept SFP+'s.
* SFP+ -- is a variation of SFP for is 10 gig.  This is the most common 10G optic you'll see.  Most SFP+ ports will also accept and work with a 1G SFP, however it has to have the 1G phy on the hardware to do it (most do).  SFP+ has an LC connector on it.
* XFP -- another 10gig specification.  (There are a bunch.)  You see these on some non-Cisco carrier type hardware (or etherprise products made by companies that also make carrier stuff.)  Seen on Alcatel-Lucent and Adtran transport gear.

When you get into 40 and 100G, there are others.  If you're getting into 40G, you should already know all of this and that too.

Optics are also painted blue of they're for a UPC connector for singlemode.  You'll see other colors which have various uses (when we get to WDM).  Some are just colored for no reason.  If you understand the wavelength and distance stuff, you can tell what an optic is by reading it.

So while we're here, ""single-mode optics"" aren't actually that..there's nothing ""single-mode"" about them.  They're just designed for single-mode.  Some optics you can use whatever you want.

----

**Wavelength**

This is where the fun starts.  Back in the day, about the best they could do was 850nm (nano-meter) wavelength light--it's visible to the naked eye and red.

These days, a bunch of wavelengths are used.  The more common ones you'll see are 850nm on MM, 1310 on MM and SM and 1550 on SM.

Wavelengths are often called ""colors"" because, well, different colors are different wavelengths.  You can't actually see the wavelengths used in fiber optics (except for 850), but they're still called colors.

You'll also see a bunch of other ones...1490 is becoming more common.  When we get to WDM, you'll understand more.

**Eye Caution?**  It is a myth that the laser is going to damage your eye--they're just not focused right.  I would still avoid staring at a 40km optic--you could manage if you tried hard enough, but it's not going to happen working with it in a normal scenario.  **There is, however** real risk if a cable breaks and the jacket fails or you're working with bare fiber that a piece can break off and become lodged in your eye.  This is very real.

----

**Actual transmission speeds**

So Ethernet over fiber came from SONET, and was originally essentially SONET optics that had been reprogrammed for ethernet frames.  As a result, gigabit on fiber is actually transmitted at 1.25gbps.  So optics will sometimes be printed with that.  Don't let it confuse you too much.  The 10 gig and 40 gig optics are actually slightly slower than their real speed, so they don't print that on them, but some manufacturers will silently imply their 1.25gbps optics will somehow get you more out of your gigabit port.

Also, outside of 1, 10, 40, and 100gig, there's a wonky 2.5g standard from STM-4.  Only ever seen it on Adtran equipment though--kinda cool though, a port you can run a 1 or 2.5gig if you want to--need the right optic though.

Go read the [SONET article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_optical_networking) for more info.  Scroll down to ""SONET/SDH data rates.""  You'll notice how many of them line up with 

----

**Standards**

(I'm not going to get into 10, 100 or FDDI speeds.)

Gigabit:
---
* 1000BASE-SX. Gigabit, 850nm light.  Is designed for 62.5um fiber, Will go 220 meters on FDDI cable and 550 meters on OM1, up to a kilometer on OM3.  Many people will tell you this is will go 550 meters on multi-mode.  You shouldn't try it on 62.5.  Won't go very far on single-mode (not usable at all, wavelength is too short).
* 1000BASE-LX. Gigabit, 1310nm light, will accept a PC or a UPC ferrule.  This is true 550m on modern 62.5 or any 50um fiber.  Will go 10km on single-mode.
* 1000BASE-ZX. 1550 light, up to 100km on single-mode.  Different optics have different powers (you can buy 10km, 20km, etc).

(some notes, this applies to 10gig and beyond too)

You have to be careful because some of the longer reach standards have **minimum distances** and you can burn them out.  Other's are smart enough and can back off on their transmission power.  There are also attenuators that you can put on and make them less loud, but you need to know what your total loss in the cable is before you can calculate what dB attenuator you need.

10G:
---

* Actually, just go read Table 1 from [this link](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/transceiver-modules/data_sheet_c78-455693.html) (about a third of the way down).  You should understand enough about wavelength, core-size, and fiber types/standards by now to understand it.

----

**Some more reading**

So, remember that thing about modal bandwidth?  Go read [this page from Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/gigabit-ethernet-gbic-sfp-modules/product_data_sheet09186a008014cb5e.html) (scroll about half way down) and you'll see wavelength, fiber, core size, and modal bandwidth (this is all gigabit)--there are similar pages for 10G, but things start getting more complicated.  You can cross reference it with [the wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber#Comparison)

That's why I'm doing it in this order--because there's a lot you can do with fiber that a lot of people don't know about.  All I'm saying is that If you're stuck with 62.5, it doesn't rule out 10 gig.  Also, just because it's 62.5 doesn't mean it's the right 62.5 for the wavelength and and distance you want to use. 

----

**Brief Review**

1. You find an old GBIC that's blue around the ports.  This is a 1 gig single-mode 10k optic.
2. You find an SFP that says ""1.25gbps 1310nm"".  This is a 1 gig optic, your distance is determined by what type of fiber you have.
3. You find an optic that's orange, but says ""1550 40km"" on it.  You'll need to do some research if you're going to use it on a 6-foot connection between racks.  But it's single-mode.
4. A colleague hands you an optic and asks if it'll work for such and such connection.  You can tell from the switch that the far-end has such-and-such optic in it and is a 1000BASE-SX module.  The optic your colleague just handed you says 1310nm on it.  No, it won't work.  

----

**Will this optic work in my switch?**

Depends.  You'll have to do some research.  Some manufacturers are dicks about it, some aren't.  It goes a couple different ways.  Generally, high-end vendors go out of their way to make you use their optics that cost 20x what generic optics cost.  Here are some examples:

Netgear, doesn't make optics.  Anything will work in them.  You might find some vendor optic that doesn't, but I can't imagine anybody going out of their way to make their $1000 optic *not* work in your Netgear.

Cisco wants you to use their optics, but there's an undocumented command ""service unsupported-transceiver"" command that will let you use whatever you want--sometimes Cisco doesn't make what you need, so they allow you to do it.  However, if you call up the TAC, you're likely to catch flak for it.  There may be similar commands on Brocade, Extreme, etc.

Some vendors crypto-key their optics to make it much harder--I'm looking at you Juniper.  You'll find clones of optics that can pass that test in most instances.

HP's commware switches will take anything, but bitch about non-HP optics in the logs, and some features (received signal strength comes to mind) don't work with generic optics.

There are basically two type of compatible optic manufacturers out there--ones that are doing a legitimate service to the industry and label their optics as ""compatible"", and others that straight-out counterfeit the brand to sell them to you at a higher price.  I find the second unethical, and even if the price is better, I will avoid them.

**Bottom Line:** Know your switch and how it treats non-branded optics.  

**Example case:**  We had (years ago) a box of GBIC's custom manufactured for our Cisco 3550's so that they could connect to the other end during a migration.  At the time, you could only get (these were BiDi optics--more on that later) SFP's (new switch) in 1490 transmit, and the only GBIC's available were 1550 receive.  The other channel on both is 1310nm, so we had a box of 1310/1490 GBIC's made, plugged in ""service unsupported-transceiver"" and off we went.  Didn't cost much--just had a minimum order (30 I think).  Not like the manufacturer cares which laser diode they put in the machine that day, right?

**Another Example:** When we deployed a ton of HP comware switches, our HP vendor couldn't get us enough optics...just couldn't.  We were even willing to pay HP's OUTRAGEOUS prices, but they just couldn't do it.  So we went to a ""compatible"" optic manufacturer and said ""here, counterfit this"".  Took a couple go arounds to get it right, but they did.  Funny, we have 2000 optics on my network that all have the same serial number, lol.

----

**What's with all this single-mode vs multi-mode thing?**

So when fiber was invented, lasers (and diodes) were very new.  Visible light lasers (850nm) where about all there was, and nobody was really concerned with huge distances.  When the need to go furthur came up, single-mode fiber was created, but it was ENORMOUSLY expensive for a laser in the right wavelength to work on it.  As a result, MM was the standard, and if you were a telecom or something, you just bit the bullet and paid through the nose for the equipment.

Now we've got tunable lasers and all sorts of cool shit.

Now that the internet has exploded, single-mode and multi-mode are cost equivalent.  In fact, in most cases, SM is cheaper than MM for the cable.  The price is parity for the optics as well.  In fact, 10G and 1G generic optics even cost the same these days.  Now, there are vendors who artificially crank up the cost for single-mode, ten-gig, and worst of all, 10-gig single-mode because if you need to run 40km, you're willing to pay for it right?

These days, use equipment that you can put any optic you want in it, and run single-mode everywhere and just be done with it.  If for some policy reason you have to use Juniper switches and juniper optics, well, that's your problem.

----

**Stands, pairs, and duplexing**

When you buy copper cable, you usually buy in by the pair (eg 25-pair cable).  With fiber, it's all strands (12-strand cable, 144-strand, etc).

For any normal connection (see WDM below), you need two strands--one is transmit, the other is receive (opposite depending on which end you're looking at).

If you're ever confused about which one is transmit and which is receive, hold the camera from your phone up to it.  It'll pick up on the infrared light and you can tell.  This works on patch panels, switches, cables, etc.  This is also a useful troubleshooting mechanism if you don't have a meter handy.

---

**Wave Division Multiplexing**

So what do when you're out of fiber?  This is called WDM.  WDM comes in a couple flavors, but basically you use different wavelengths of light and a prism to combine them onto a single strand at one side and another prism to split them back out into different strands at the other.  This lets you put more than one connection on the pair, and none of them interfere with each other.  They don't even have to be the same speed or anything, and the equipment can be anything you want--so long as you can get the right optics.  You will see fiber-channel, ethernet, and SONET all on the same pair of fiber between buildings sometimes. 

You only ever see WDM in single-mode applications.  **Edit:** Evidently they're doing on MMF although I know little about it.

You take a massive power loss on passive WDM equipment.  You can use active equipment or higher power optics if you need that.

Probably the most common place you see WDM is in bi-directional optics (called BiDi optics).  You have to use them in matched pairs but one end transmits on one frequency and receives on another.  The other end does the opposite.  There's essentially just a piece of glass in each optic that accomplishes this.  They're usually color coded (eg, blue at one end, green at the other).  When you're dealing with interconnecting two different vendors equipment, you have to read the optics' specs to find out if they're compatible--**this is why I went through so much trouble explaining wavelength, speed, etc.**  Common pairs are 1310/1550, 1310/1490 and 1310/1270.  This is normally where you'll see colors on optics other than blue.  Sometimes the manufacturer will change the colors on you and you have to be aware of wavelengths--for example, a vendor we used to use went from blue/green to green/yellow at one point.  Hard to keep straight, so just read the optic.

The rest of WDM is more complicated than is worth trying to explain it here.  Go read the wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing).  If you're that far in over your head, I can explain more.

Some caveats: 40gig is 4x10gig channels already muxed on the two strands.  100gig is 4 25gig channels, so you can't do WDM as easily with them.  You'll have to find special muxes and optics in that case.

----
**DB and power levels**

The biggest thing you'll run into--provided you're now smart enough to get the optics, cable, and patch cable right at both ends is loss.  Every patch takes a hit, and you take attenuation the longer a distance you're trying to shoot the light.

If you're switches support it, you should definitely be monitoring and tracking received signal strength.  This helps you see that something still ""working"" is, say, coming lose or such.

Typically you take a .3-.75dB hit at every connection.  All of this adds up and can keep you from having a stable network.  WDM technologies take hits from the prisms.  You can use louder optics, but in some cases (MMF scenarios, or maybe your vendor just doesn't make a 20km fiber-channel optic) you don't have that option, so it's something you have to actively manage if you're going to be a successful fiber guy.

You'll have to learn about dB and logarithmic scales, but that's outside of the scope of this.

[Here's a pretty good write-up about it.](http://www.thefoa.org/tech/loss-est.htm)

---

**Equipment**

Some equipment you'll likely use is:

* VFL -- Visual Fault Locator.  Essentially a pen laser that will tell you where a fiber is broken.  They're mostly useful for identifying where a strand of fiber is.  Hook it up at one end, and then go look at all the connections at the other.  Find the red blinky light.  They're cheap.  Get one
* Fusion Splicer -- Ours was $25k used.  It's the only way to get a good splice when loss counts.
* Light source and meter.  Essentially a doo-dad that sends whatever wavelength you tell it down the fiber and tells you how much loss you're getting.
* Certifier -- Somewhere between a light source and meter and an OTDR.  Will tell you if the fiber passes standard tests for transmission...e.g. Did you fuck up the termination or not, or is the fiber defective and you're 100 meter run won't work even though it should.
* OTDR -- Optical Time Domain Reflectometer.  Expensive.  Kind of a certifier on steroids.  What it does (among many, many other things) is send a pulse of light down fiber and tell you where defects (or breaks) are by measuring the time it takes the light to travel there and reflect back.  Will also tell you how long a cable is (so will your certifier).
* Your phone.  Probably the one I use the most.  Picks up on the infrared light that you cant see.  Tells you if a connection is hot.

There's more, but this is what you'll deal with the most.

----

**Splicing and terminating**

Back in the day, you had to polish under a microscope the ends of fiber.  You don't have to do that anymore.  Most termination mechanisms simply have a special goop (technical term) in them and some spiffy tools to make sure you got it inserted far enough into the end.  That's it.

For repairs (or any other kind of splicing), there are mechanical splices (goop), chemical splices (though these are uncommon), and fusion splices.

The chemical splices work by putting the fiber into a special goop and sending a special wavelength light though the fiber.  The goop hardens chemically and becomes part of the fiber.

Fusion splicing is essentially an expensive arc welder than melts the strands and causes them to fuse.  Fusion splicing is the best way to splice fiber.  Each type of splicing takes a different loss hit from fusion (best) to mechanical (worst).

When a fiber has been spliced too many times, in addition to all the patches and such in the path, there may be too much loss to make it usable.

----
**Security**

Every few weeks I have a customer complaining about how fiber is insecure.  It's true, but we're an ISP, so if you don't trust the world with your traffic, you shouldn't trust us with it either.

There are doo-dads that you can clamp onto outdoor fiber and steal the data off of it without taking the connection down.  I've helped the FBI do it.  If your traffic goes outdoors and is sensitive, encrypt that shit.  And monitor your power levels--that's the only way you'll know this has happened.

----

**What is this whole ""mode"" thing anyway?**

So when you send light down fiber, imagine that instead of a straight line, there are beams that all didn't enter the fiber at the same angle.  As these beams bounce back and forth, some travel much further distances relative to the other rays.  This causes the pulse to spread out.  Additionally, some of the rays end up destructively interfering with each other and cancel each other out.

**That's actually not really what happens** but the analogy holds pretty well.  The physics are much more complicated.  Go read the [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_dispersion) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode) if you want to understand it.

But, when the wavelength is more than about 10-times the diameter of the fiber, it stops acting like a beam and a more like a coherent wave front.  Imagine dropping a rock into a rain gutter full of water, you'll have a straight wave going down the gutter..   This is why the fiber in SMF is so small and the wavelengths used are so long.

Modal dispersion occurs in single-mode fiber, but not anywhere nearly as pronounced.  Long story short, that's why distance is limited in MMF regardless of power (mostly), and you can go a nearly unlimited distance (100km is the max I've seen) in SMF before you need to regenerate the signal.  It's also why the longer-reach MMF technologies use a longer wavelength--because the modal dispersion is less pronounced at that wavelength.

There's another phenomenon called chromatic dispersion which occurs because different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds in glass.  I don't know if this is a concern in WDM systems or not.

Interestingly, when I got to the office at ~8am on Thanksgiving day my first couple hours were spent dealing with a problem of actual tubes instead of metaphorical tubes.  [Our fizzy water machine had decided to start leaking sometime in the middle of the night.](https://i.imgur.com/n0YIgcJ.jpg)  If I hadn't been doing this work today, no one would have see this until Monday and the damage would have been MUCH worse.

So after shutting off the water, making the required phone calls and letting in the cleanup crews, I was able to get to work.  Wearing my [lucky shirt](https://i.imgur.com/S2XYjRI.jpg) I took one last snapshot of all configs and a deep breath, and at 10:43am shut down all the interfaces on the edge firewalls.

By 11:30 I'd cleaned out enough of the old mess to be able to start building new security policies.  We previously had ~180 rules, and almost all of them needed to be adjusted in some way and none of it was common enough to script.  Once I was done with those I moved onto the NAT policies, then the Policy based forwarding, and by 1pm I was starting to re-patch everything.

The patching took a solid 4 hours, but it was some of the most fun I've had in my career.  I knew what needed to be done and was so excited to finally be getting to clean up this mess after months of planning that I was jogging from IDF to IDF because walking was just too damn slow.  I had my charts and diagrams printed out and I'd pre-staged most of the new cables beforehand, so much of the time was removing the old pile of spaghetti and installing new cable management.

At 5:15pm, I got OSPF neighbor relationships forming between the new core switch and the edge firewalls.  At 7:15pm all of the IDFs were back online, and at 7:25 the DHCP relays were pointed back to the servers and I was greeted by the ""Bloo-loo-loo-looop!"" noises from around the office as all of our VoIP phones started regaining connectivity.  At 9pm, after verifying that all of the VLANs had internet connectivity and I could get to our network drives and AWS VPC, I sent a status e-mail and went home.

Yesterday (friday) I arrived at 9am to let in the next round of clean-up crews for the water damage, and got back to testing and documenting the changes. There's been some minor glitches that I've taken care of, but almost all of yesterday and today has simply been cleaning up the old switch configs, clearing out now-unused VLANs and labeling things both in the configs as well as with physical labels on the devices themselves (And almost complete depleted our stock of label maker tape).  This cleaning up has taken a surprisingly long time in the Palo Altos because VLANs and interfaces are referenced in SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES that you have to hunt through the entire system clearing everything out before you can actually delete them.

I only ran into one real roadblock that required a call to support.  It turns out that when you're putting an Ether-channel pair through a Palo Alto firewall in Virtual Wire mode, you have to create two separate virtual wires instead of aggregating the ether-channel onto the firewall itself (as described in this article that the nice support lady linked me to: https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClHTCA0).  Once I got that straightened out, it was mostly clear sailing and everything went according to plan.  Which still kinda freaks me out . . . 

Now I'm standing here looking at everything and it's all working.  Quite, happy little packets just humming along, getting where there going in a much more logical way than before.  But there's a very real part of me that is utterly perplexed that I was able to implement this whole thing and that it actually worked.

If there's a single most valuable lesson that I can take away from this, it's to ALWAYS MAKE A CHECKLIST.  There were so many times that I was getting overly excited and flustered that I absolutely would have missed something major if I had not made a very long and detailed list beforehand when I was not quite so fizzy-brained.  Every time I started to get ahead of myself, I could turn back to the list and just focus on the next step.

And now I'm going to spend the rest of the day relaxing by writing documentation, and then head home this evening to do some MORE obsessive planning and engineering.  Because a transfer window to Jool is opening soon and I've got contracts to land my little green men on Laythe as well as do a rescue from Vall, and when you're playing with an unforgiving life support mod you need to plan your missions out in great detail if you're going to have a hope of getting home. ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/a02aat/update_i_shut_down_my_company_over_thanksgiving/,[UPDATE] I shut down my company over thanksgiving to do a network migration and somehow it all worked.,,757,110,0.97

jd23nw,networking,1602965046.0,"## What is Wi-Fi 6E?

Wi-Fi 6E is Wi-Fi 6 extended into the newly unlocked 6 GHz spectrum. 

On April 23, 2020 the [United States FCC voted](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/the-fcc-ratified-wi-fi-6e-this-morning/) to allow the unlicensed use of the 6 GHz band. This added 1200 MHz (5.925 to 7.125 GHz) of spectrum for devices like Wi-Fi access points. Previously, devices operating in this band had to be licensed, which prevented use by the general public. This added spectrum is arguably the biggest change in wireless networking since the [original 802.11 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_(legacy_mode)) came out in 1997, or the original allocation of the [ISM bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) in 1985. 

For perspective, there is only 260 MHz of unrestricted spectrum available in other bands. The exact channels available vary by region, but without getting bogged down in specifics:
- 80 MHz unrestricted in the [2.4 GHz ISM band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#2.4_GHz_(802.11b/g/n/ax)).
- 180 MHz unrestricted in the [5 GHz band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#5_GHz_or_5.9_GHz_(802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax)).
- 500 MHz requiring Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) in the [5 GHz band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#5_GHz_or_5.9_GHz_(802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax)).
	- [DFS channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_selection) require an access point to continuously monitor for the presence of weather or military radar signals. Wi-Fi access points using DFS channels are required to back off to avoid interference. Due to this, DFS channels are often either not supported or not used. 

This limited amount of contiguous spectrum makes it difficult to enable wider 80 MHz or 160 MHz channels, and can cause channel re-use and interference. The 6 GHz spectrum allows for any combination of the following:

- 59 additional 20 MHz channels.
- 29 additional 40 MHz channels.
- 14 additional 80 MHz channels.
- 7 additional 160 MHz channels.
- 3 potential 320 MHz channels, due to be included in the 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) standard.

## What Is 6 GHz Used For Currently?

The 6 GHz band is in use by many licensed services. In the US, there are 47,695 unique uses between 5.925 and 7.125 GHz. Namely fixed point-to-point radios, fixed satellite service (FSS), broadcast auxiliary service (BAS), and cable television relay services (CARS).

An incomplete list of services using 6 GHz:

- Communication to geostationary satellites.
- Police and fire dispatch services.
- Management of electric grids.
- Control of natural gas and oil pipelines.
- Coordination of railroad train movements.
- Fixed wireless backhaul by service providers like AT&T and Verizon.
- Mobile TV stations and video relay from remote locations.
- Radio Astronomy.
- Portable cameras and wireless microphones.
- Long-distance telephone service.
- Ultra-wideband systems.

## Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) is the New DFS

In the US, the [6 GHz band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#6_GHz_(802.11ax)) is broken down into the U-NII-5, U-NII-6, U-NII-7 and U-NII-8 sub bands, with different rules for each. 

Indoors, the full 1200 MHz is unrestricted and can be used by normal Wi-Fi networks without concern for those existing services. This is due to the nature of radio transmissions in the 6 GHz rapidly attenuating. In the vast majority of situations, indoor 6 GHz devices won’t be able to detect outdoor radio transmissions. Low-power indoor 6 GHz devices will use the existing CSMA/CA protocol to provide medium access fairness and coordinate wireless transmissions.

Outdoor use of 6 GHz is a little more complicated. Only the U-NII-5 and U-NII-7 sub bands can be used. Due to the large amount of critical infrastructure running in the 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E devices operating outdoors will need to implement Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC). This is similar to how 5 GHz devices using DFS channels need to monitor for radar, and defer to their use of the channel. AFC works by having 6 GHz wireless networking equipment connect to a cloud-based AFC database to report their position. The AFC database would determine the risks of interference with incumbent services and assign a specific channel to the AP.

## What Does Wi-Fi 6E Give Us?

TL;DR: Higher capacity, higher speeds, and lower latency. 

The only devices that will be able to operate in the 6 GHz spectrum are devices that are based on the Wi-Fi (802.11ax) standard. Unlike every other Wi-Fi standard, there is no backwards compatibility for the 6 GHz band. 

To be clear: 

- Wi-Fi 6E client devices will be able to join and use legacy 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. 
- Devices supporting Wi-Fi 6 and older standards will not be able to operate in the 6 GHz band. 
- Most Wi-Fi 6E networks will be dual or tri-band, allowing older clients to connect using the old spectrum, while exclusively allowing 6E clients to operate over 6 GHz. 

The lack of backward compatibility is a feature, not a bug. This will limit usage of 6 GHz until Wi-Fi 6E devices are more common, but it provides a lot of benefits. Every Wi-Fi 6E device will support Wi-Fi 6 technologies like [OFDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiple_access) and Target Wake Time, making transmissions more efficient. OFDMA requires all devices participating in the transmission to be synchronized. Time, frequency, and power must all be synchronized between the AP and client. OFDMA only becomes fully effective when all client devices and access points use it.

Older Wi-Fi generations like 802.11n and 802.11ac were based on [OFDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing) modulation, where each channel was fully reserved to a single user for each transmission. In contrast, OFDMA divides the channel into sub-channels, also known as Resource Units (RU). This allows multiple users to communicate simultaneously, rather than waiting for their turn. Each time a Wi-Fi 5 or older device transmits in a Wi-Fi 6 network, the transmission reverts back to standard OFDM with a single transmission occupying the entire spectrum. Flipping back and forth between OFDM and OFDMA degrades the network for everyone, especially Wi-Fi 6 devices. Things get even slower when older, low data rate devices supporting 802.11b or 802.11g are in the mix.

Going forward, Wi-Fi 6E devices will be a lot less of a drag on 6 GHz networks than legacy devices are on current 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Until now, Wi-Fi standards have always been backward compatible with previous standards. This allows older and newer devices to interoperate, but restricts overall data throughput to the rates supported by the slowest devices. Legacy devices such as 802.11b/g/n require more airtime to transmit data, increasing latency and reducing throughput for all users. This policy towards always supporting old standards is a great benefit and strength of Wi-Fi. Unfortunately it can also impair the performance of even the highest-end Wi-Fi 6 devices using the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Taken as a whole, the 6 GHz band will allow for more ubiquitous usage of the required aspects of high performance wireless transmissions. All 6 GHz transmitters and receivers will include all the advances in Wi-Fi 6, including wide channels, 1024-QAM modulation, and OFDMA. 6 GHz will provide a cleaner RF environment with less interference, with less issues caused by adjacent or overlapping channel interference. The same policies that guide Wi-Fi network design will still apply, but this big chunk of new spectrum will allow for more design flexibility, better performance, and a better experience for everyone.

## Potential Problems with Wi-Fi 6E

If the rollout of Wi-Fi 6E is anything like Wi-Fi 6, early devices will likely skip optional features, or have non-working implementations of key technologies like OFDMA. Small Net Builder has a few great articles about [the current state of Wi-Fi 6 OFDMA](https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-features/33223-does-ofdma-really-work-part-2). That same dynamic will likely apply to early Wi-Fi 6E devices. The earliest Wi-Fi 6E devices may not fully comply with the standard, may not implement every feature, and may not perform as expected.

Another potential issue is all the design, testing, and validation that will be required. Wi-Fi 6E brings a lot of new engineering challenges for network operators and device manufacturers. Existing Wi-Fi components and equipment used for design and manufacturing are optimized for frequencies below 6 GHz. Retooling for support up to 7.125 GHz will require changes to antenna design, manufacturing, and validation. Devices will need to be calibrated and tested up to the highest frequencies to ensure that they can generate the expected power levels.

Wi-Fi 6E devices will likely be dual or tri-band, complicating heat dissipation and power management for the multiple bands and MIMO streams to coexist. Proper band isolation will need to be developed and tested to avoid interference within the device. More coexistence testing will need to be done, and multiple bands need to be tested simultaneously. All of these things increase complexity. Even well-engineered Wi-Fi 6E devices are likely going to be power hungry, increasing PoE requirements for access points and limiting battery life on mobile devices.

Another potential issue relates to the scanning and probing that Wi-Fi devices perform when looking for an access point to join. With 1200 MHz to cover and 59 potential 20 MHz channels to scan, a client would require around 6 seconds to complete a passive scan of the entire band. This would cause many roaming and association issues, so the IEEE proposed a fast passive scanning method using a reduced set of channels called Preferred Scanning Channels (PSC). PSCs are a set of fifteen 20 MHz channel spaced every four channels (80 MHz) apart. Passive scanning of these fifteen PSCs reduces the total scan time to the more manageable 1.5 seconds. This is yet another feature of Wi-Fi 6E that will need to be developed, tested, and perfected. 

A lot of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E features sound great on paper, but come with compromises. For example, wider channel widths cause network design challenges, and often run into physical limits. A wider channel requires more OFDMA data carriers being transmitted and received simultaneously. An 80 MHz channel has 996 sub-carriers, while 160 MHz channel has twice that. In a wide channel, the SNR per carrier is reduced, and requires higher signal strength for a successful transmission. Saturating a wide channel with Wi-Fi 6E devices will be hard to do in practice, especially since a lot of this complexity is being pushed onto device manufacturers. Just like with current devices, it will only take one poorly designed Wi-Fi 6E device or one bad actor to limit everyone’s performance. That’s the unavoidable nature of using a shared medium like Wi-Fi.

## When Can We Expect Wi-Fi 6E? Should I Wait?

At first, Wi-Fi 6E was a US-only affair. In July 2020, [Ofcom voted](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/ofcom-brings-wi-fi-into-6-ghz) to allow 500 MHz of the 6 GHz band in the UK. In October 2020, [MSIT voted](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/msit-brings-wi-fi-into-6-ghz) to allow 6 GHz use in South Korea.

There’s no official timeline for when regulators around the world will make the spectrum available for unlicensed use. Wi-Fi 6E has no definitive release date in most countries. In the US, Wi-Fi 6E devices will probably start appearing in 2021 and become more common heading into 2022. 

During CES 2020, Broadcom announced several system-on-a-chip products that router manufacturers can purchase to create Wi-Fi 6E devices. Qualcomm also has [Wi-Fi 6E chipsets](https://www.qualcomm.com/wi-fi-6e) available. Intel announced that it will have WI-Fi 6E chips available in January 2021. The Wi-Fi Alliance plans to have their Wi-Fi 6E certification ready by early 2021, but devices using a draft Wi-Fi 6E certification may be out before then.

Wi-Fi 6E should be a big improvement for high-density and high-speed networks, but it is unlikely to make a large difference in most people’s homes. Think about dense Wi-Fi networks in a convention center, or a stadium — that’s where I think the extra spectrum from Wi-Fi 6E will be most relevant. It should also have a big impact on wireless mesh networks, but time will tell. Keep in mind that only Wi-Fi 6E devices will be able to use the new spectrum, meaning none of the devices you have now will see any benefit.

I've seen many people say that they wouldn't consider buying any networking equipment that doesn't support Wi-Fi 6E. I can't tell you what to buy or what to do, but I don't think that holding out for Wi-Fi 6E is necessary, especially for a home network. Getting use of a Wi-Fi 6E network will require all new devices, and we don't have any of those yet. Even after you can buy Wi-Fi 6E-enabled devices, it will take time until the benefits are relevant to most people. If you have an older network, it might make more sense to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 now, and wait for mature Wi-Fi 6E products or Wi-Fi 7 which is due in 2023 or 2024. By then, clients supporting 6 GHz should be more common, and the upgrade cost will make more sense.

If you want to chase high channel widths and high data rates, Wi-Fi 6E has plenty to offer. It’s an exciting time for Wi-Fi, but it helps to have patience. Wi-Fi 6E may be right around the corner, but it isn’t here yet.

Anyway, I've recently changed jobs and I wanted to give my two cents when it comes to ""up-skilling"" oneself and what one should focus on, especially in today's environment.

[Some of you](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/6gda1t/salary_difference_between_network_engineers_who/) seem to believe that a network engineer + automation (whatever that translates to for you) is not yet ""worth the time"" or that it's ""just a fad"", at least from a perspective of *what's the salary difference?*. It's true, you're probably not gonna earn double your current rate just by knowing some python. What is also true is that the ground is shifting, and while knowing some ""automation"" is not a *kill-or-be-unemployed* kind of situation (yet), it will get there with time.

## Where I come from

A few months ago I passed my CCIE (R&S). I was working for Amazon for about 2 years as an NDE. As anyone that has worked in Amazon can tell you, a CCIE is pretty worthless in the sense that you're hardly ever gonna use any cisco-specific stuff. I did it because I had it among my goals ever since I got into networking. 

Amazon is doing tons of recruiting for network engineers, they never seem to have enough. As a NE yourself, after about 6 months you are placed on the interview rotation as an interviewer, be it phone screens or on-sites.  As you can imagine, generally people ""throw themselves"" to get into Amazon, yet the % of people that pass all interviews is miniscule. Rejections are the norm even after ~3 phone-screens and a 6 hour on-site. A few months before I left we got a directive where now **scripting / coding  or *automation-oriented mindset* is a mandatory requirement** - before it was just a ""nice to have"" and while it was tested, you couldn't really be disqualified just because you don't know some python.

This change happened even though our rejection rate is already thorough the roof... and you can imagine what that number might look like now.

I wanted to move on from Amazon and explore something else, so I did some job searching. One thing I realized recently: **NETWORKING IS IMPORTANT.**, and I don't mean the tech kind but the people kind. While before I couldn't give two shits about what other people do, never participated in any networking event, etc, I realized that that was a terrible mistake. Yes, I am still not as chatty as I'd like, nor can I really care about others, but forming relationships is important, especially when you are looking for a new job.

As an anecdot, I was talking with an ex colleague about the fact that I was looking for a new gig, and he immediately let me know that they were ""kinda looking"" for somebody for a position for which he's the hiring manager. This job was an 18-months contract with double the salary I used to have in Amazon, and since I had worked both with him and the project's tech lead, they were happy to skip formalities and start immediately. No interview, no anything. Mind that there was no way I was getting this offer from some website like Indeed. This role was never publicly published (which is reserved for a last-resord kind of thing in many companies) ( *I later on decided not to accept, as the gig was very Cisco ACI-heavy and that's not something I want to focus on at this point in my career* ).

After some other calls, I had two offers in my hand, one from a Fortune 500 company, and one from a smaller, leaner company. The F500 company's offer was 30% higher what they had in mind to pay as ""the top"" ( I got wind of this from a person I know which works at the same company ). They tossed this up to ""it's extremely rare finding someone with both network and ""automation"" skills"".

In the end I accepted the offer from the smaller company, mainly because:

-	I've been in big companies my whole carrier and wanted to see the other side
-	Money is not a big part of my life at the moment, as in, it's not my absolute number 1 focus when job-hunting (as long as it's on my minimun acceptable)
-	Connecting to the point above, **learning** is my number 1 priority job-wise, and in my current role I can deal with Docker / Ansible / Jinja2 / YAML / Python / Jenkins / AWS / Azure / GC and more and I spend most of my day writing in python or fixing Ansible playbooks / jinja templates etc.

When you come from a company like Amazon, the use of free/open-source tools which form knowledge that you can then bring anywhere else is really refreshing. I am also relatively young, so knowledge/experience acquisition is my main focus at the moment.

After the first month on the job at my new company, I got into recruiting other network engineers, since we need more and quickly. We had the same requirements as Amazon (notice a trend?), the only difference is that, after 10s of rejections (and we rejected 100s without even an interview just because the CV didn't fit), we relaxed our search to somebody that has rock-solid networking experience and **an automation mindset**.

I've mentioned this before in the text, **so what does having an *automation mindset* mean?** It doesn't mean you know Docker or how to program in Python, nor that you know what an Ansible playbook is. What it means is ""can this person in front of me **think programmatically** and would he/she be able to and **is motivated** to learn tools / languages?"". Basically, if I ask you ""how would you configure a description on the same interface on 10,000 devices?"" your answer better not be ""I open 10,000 SSH connections and multi-input the config on all at the same time"". Having the ability to at least write some pseudo-code or describe how would you approach and resolve a problem programmaticly is crucial.

**Is there a premium paid because you know Python / Ansible / Jinja / TextFSM / whatever ?** The answer is ***YES.*** This generally comes in various forms:

-	It's your foot in the door for positions for which you would have been otherwise not even considered

-	You generally get a 10-30% premium in total comp

-	You generally spend more time in ""high level stuff"" than ""low level stuff"", or it's at least a combination of the two. This makes sense if you think about it - these companies want you to automate away boring stuff or build tools that remove the human from the equation (auto-remediation tools, config-generation / validation / deployment tools, etc).

Is there a learning curve? Absolutely. Are certifications dead? Far from it, but you better supplement with something else. Once I finally passed my CCIE I didn't just rest and stopped. I always like to remind myself that if you're not improving today in some way, then that means you've just gotten worse. What brought you till here won't bring you any further (God I sound like a motivational speaker...). (Sidenote, I still have plenty of INE tokens from my CCIE lab days, feel free to PM me if you're interested).

Look, you're not gonna be out of a job just yet, we all know it. 10 years from now you will probably still find job postings for ""normal"" network engineers. Many of you came into networking because ""not much changes"" over years. BGP is BGP, TCP is still the same TCP from 30 years ago (minus some improvements).

I doubt TCP will radically change in 10 years (for that, I doubt that IPv6 will globally catch on in 10 years too), but our interaction with network devices, how protocols are configured, how devices are monitored, etc is gonna change (it has already in many networks).

## On learning new skills

Here's the deal: **you don't have to learn 100 technologies / tools / languages top to bottom all in 1 week**. It's extremely easy to get overwhelmed when you look at *what should I learn now?*. This is especially true if you, like me, just finished with a major ""learning block"" recently (e.g CCIE). The beauty of a certification program is that the requirements and sub-requirements are all listed there, you go through this list and *poof*, you can go and give the exam and you have a piece of paper that proves you ""worked on this"". It's much more difficult when everything is self-directed. You could choose to learn anything, but how do you know what's important and what's a fad? How do you know what skills will you need 5, 10 years from now VS skills which will become obsolete the next round of the hype-cycle?

If I've learned anything about learning any subject is the following:

1) **Learn very well the basics**, because anything you're gonna build on top of those foundations will make or break you (and your career). If you don't know how ARP works, forget about Python or Ansible or whatever. Go read some RFCs or some books. If you're 10 years in your career and still don't know all the TCP flags, I have bad news for you.

2) **Don't follow hype / (pre)sales speak / vendor speak.** You know what I can be reasonably sure of in 5 or 10 years? That BASH will still be here. It's also extremely probable that Python will still be here. Will Jinja2 be the templating standard 10 years from now? Probably not. When deciding where to move next, you probably will want to move to technologies or skills that will come in handy on the long run. Ansible is built on top of Python. If you knew Python, don't you think you'd be able to pick up Ansible very quickly? I'm not even suggesting you need to learn Python, but you should develop a programming mindset and exercise it in whatever language you want.

3) **Don't forget.** Impossible? Yes, remembering 100% of everything may not be possible nor desirable (do you really need to remember that last episode of GOT?) but you can achieve 90-95% for your most important information (you know, information that actually makes you money... ) and that's what you want. What I'm talking about is *spaced repetition*, which comes in the incarnation of a software called Anki (there are others, but that's what I use). This method of remembering works wonders especially for our field, where information is generally ""certain"", as in, there's a document specifying what's the intended behavior. You can apply this to both network engineering info and programming (generally you want to memorize some of the most used and useful base libraries of your language of choice). Have a [read here](https://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method) for how one guy applied Anki to programming (but it can be generalize for almost anything).

4) **Take it one step at a time and be reasonable.** You can't learn everything at once - prioritize and chip away at it over a period of time. Knowledge compounds like compound interest. The more you know about something, the easier it is to learn something different but somewhat related because you already have references in your knowledge base to the underlying subject. If you know how a python dictionary works, then you can learn how to read a YAML file and make use of that data. If you know YAML or Python, then you can already correlate that to why Jinja2 allows you to access variables with the `$PARENT_KEY.CHILD_KEY.SUB_CHILD_KEY` construct or with  `$PARENT_KEY[""CHILD_KEY""][""SUB_CHILD_KEY""]` (which is the same thing).

Look, I'm not here to tell you that I have all the right answers or hell, even a majority. Like I said, I'm pretty young and my opinion might radically change in 10 years. What I am saying is that you should probably stop making excuses on why today you've not learned 1 more thing. I've seen plenty of network engineers that like to kind of ""coast"" and live off only of their current knowledge. These are the people that write in the resume ""10 years of experience"" when in reality it's 1 year of experience repeated 10 times.

Don't be one of them.

Cheers.

ueaett,networking,1651195323.0,"I spend several hours a day doing sales engineering, and in the course of talking packets, waves, MTU, throughput, peering, and everything in between, I've learned that sometimes people will just call to talk.

A customer calls and asks about adding a wave to add redundancy to another one of their sites.  Right now they are SD-WAN and they of course want the benefit of lower latency and vertical integration by adding a wave to the mix, totally normal stuff.

After a while, he starts talking about his personal life and what's going on.  You end up kind of becoming friends with these people over the course of time working with them.  You recognize their voices, see their posts on linked in, and just generally keep up.

After about an hour into the conversation, he just sighed and said, ""I don't really need the wave, man.""  I think to myself, ""Ah, I guess it's out of his budget, it is kinda pricey."" I tell him I can work with the engineering team on lowering the price, and that we can stretch it to a longer commit to compensate for build out, or even go back and see if we can bundle or change something else to lower the monthly cost.

""No, to be honest, I just called because I need someone to talk to and you were the only person that came to my mind.""  He starts sobbing, and telling me about how after he graduated from University, he just felt so disconnected from the world, and all his relationships just felt so superficial.  He said that his only friends are work friends and that he doesn't even feel like anyone talks to him just to talk.

We ended up talking about life, emotions, and what it really means to live in this world for another hour.  I even stayed after and came home late.  The only reason he quit talking is that his kid had gotten home from school.

The crazy thing? I have these conversations like once a week.  I tell people we are like family, and that we're not just here as salesmen.  I think it's important we remember that we all have shared interests in our jobs, and that it doesn't mean we aren't people, and we aren't all one in this big scary world together.

When he apologized at one point, my managed walked in, and I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""Don't worry man, there's enough fiber for everyone.  Call back anytime."" He just said, ""Thanks, is it okay if I call next week?"" and I said, ""Sounds good, see you next week.""

My boss asked how that call went, and I said ""great"" and he patted me on the shoulder and said, ""sounds good"".  I half way wonder if he wasn't listening too because he was a little teary eyed.

This course is aimed at Network Engineers that want to learn Python.  It covers Python fundamentals, but using exercises and examples that are more relevant to network engineers. That being said it is definitely a course oriented towards beginners (from a Python programming perspective).

The course consists of eight lessons. The lessons are delivered via email and consist of videos, exercises, and additional content. The course schedule is as follows:

* Week1 - Why Python, the Python Interpreter Shell, and Strings
* Week2 - Numbers, Files, Lists, and Linter
* Week3 - Conditionals and Loops
* Week4 - Dictionaries, Exceptions, and Regular Expressions
* Week5 - Functions and the Python Debugger
* Week6 - Netmiko Basics
* Week7 - Jinja2 Basics, Introduction to YAML and JSON, Complex Data Structures
* Week8 - Libraries, Package Installation, and Virtual Environments

&#x200B;

Weeks number 6 and 7 are a bit more about directly applying Python to a couple of common network engineering use cases and less about Python fundamentals. 

  
The course is in Python3 (though generally in a manner that is pretty easily compatible with Python2). Sign-up is available here:

Friday night I'm hanging out in the United club lounge at the airport waiting for my flight to start boarding when my phone lights up with texts from Solarwinds that some stuff has gone down, including a bunch of stuff (like our Edge switches) that made no sense.

So I VPN in, which was weird because if our edge switches were both down then I wouldn't have been able to connect to the VPN.  I couldn't get to some devices through the regular network but I was still able to access them through our Cradle-point Out-Of-Band cellular backup network, and everything looked like it was still passing traffic just fine.

Initially I was thinking this was a Solarwinds freakout, but then after a couple of minutes of checking things I realized that one of the switches in our collapsed core (we have a pair of stacked C9300s that act as both Core and Distribution layer) had died.  

But because I'd been neurotic about dual-homing all of our Access layer switches and server switches, and making sure that all other systems that connected to the core were as redundant as possible . . . no one noticed.  There was some reduced bandwidth internally, but there was no downtime for anything and aside from us in the IT department, no one knew there was any sort of a problem.

By this time I'd boarded my flight, but I opened a TAC case from the in-flight wi-fi and once I got back on site Saturday morning I was able to sort out what happened.

It turns out that one of the switches in the core stack had experienced a spontaneous reboot for unknown reasons, but then it stayed down because the ""Manual Boot"" option was set.  Once I was in the console and issued a Boot command, it came back up and everything was hunky-dory.  I turned off the manual boot option, cycled in again and we're good.

Lessons learned:

* Out-Of-Band management networks are super duper awesome and I'm so glad that I put it in place.
* High-availability is super duper awesome and I'm so glad that I insisted we spend the money on it, rather than cheaping out and crossing our fingers that nothing goes wrong.
* Some ethernet serial devices might be worth it so I can get into the console remotely, rather than just the management interface
* Maybe I'm not as bad at my job as I'm always worried that I am.

ffblzq,networking,1583668741.0,"Inspired by the famous ""YSK about fiber"" post.

I realized there's a certain aura about firewalls in this field. Firewalls can be tricky. They are born to drop traffic and sometimes they do it unexpectedly, leading to long troubleshooting sessions.

Also, while everybody here agrees that routing and switching is part of the job, not everybody agrees on firewalls. Sometimes, they are managed by a separate team entirely.

So I decided to write down something, in an attempt to clear up some things about how firewalls work. I hope this helps.

=========

A firewall is a default-deny device. What is not explicitly allowed is forbidden.

#**Basic concepts**
I think some of the mystery aura about firewalls is because there's a whole vocabulary of new concepts. And we all know how vendors make things easier when dealing with naming things /s


**Policy/rule**. Identifies source zone, destination zone (if any), source, destination, port, application, action, profile.

**Zones**. A zone is a group of physical or virtual interfaces with similar functions and which *usually* have the same trust level.
When you set up zones, firewalls put a default-allow rule for traffic within the zone itself. 
However, you can also set up fine-grained policies which can deny even traffic that stays in the same zone (so-called ""intra-zone blocking""). Microsegmentation relies on this.

**Application**. An application (sometimes called service) is an actual Layer 7 protocol (or application, more on that later) that is recognized by the firewall. 
This allows you to set up policies that don't just allow traffic to tcp/8443, but only https traffic to that port. 

Some firewalls take this a step further, and are able to recognize actual applications like Facebook or Office365, mostly by checking domains and IPs plus some heuristics.
This means you can set up a policy like ""10.0.0.0/8 to Internet, application=Facebook, deny"". Of course these things are not 100% foolproof.

Obviously, you can still use Layer4 ports in your policies, it's just an additional tool.

**Action**. Permit/deny/log.

**Profile**. A profile is a security capability of the firewall that goes beyond simple L3 permit/deny. Examples: antivirus scanning, TLS inspection, URL filtering.

This means you can set up a policy that permits traffic but, for example, performs an  AV scanning on what's being sent.

The implementation of these features can be tricky and often relies on weaknesses in the protocols that are then fixed. Basically, TLS inspection is a MitM attack performed by a firewall. 
So, as protocols are fixed to improve privacy and make MitM attacks harder, NGFW vendors race to make their own MitM possible... or suggest people to disable these new features.

AV scanning can be either proxy-based or stream-based, in which case the firewall examines files block by block. You can also set up your firewalls to send suspicious files to a sandbox, or to an external antivirus platform (Virustotal-like).

URL filtering relies on the fact that HTTPS doesn't usually hide the domain and, if TLS inspection is enabled, it also examines the actual URL in the payload. Firewalls then keep a database which classifies URLs in categories (travel, gambling, health, cryptomining,...).
This is also useful for compliance reasons. Example: you don't want to carry out TLS inspection when people access health-related websites.

**Instances**. Firewalls can often act as L3 devices, so you can sometimes set up VRFs and virtual routers on them (thanks to /u/JollyAnybody for pointing out the difference).
You can also set up ""partitions"", basically multiple virtual firewalls that can be managed separately, by different people. 

As usual, vendors like to call the same thing in different ways.
So, partitions are called ""contexts"" by Cisco (ASA and FTD), ""logical systems"" by Juniper, ""virtual systems"" by Palo Alto, ""virtual domains"" (VDOM) by Fortinet. But, guess what? They are exactly the same thing.

**Objects and groups**. An object is an IP or IP range that is given a name. This allows you to: 

1) create human-readable policies, which don't rely on rote memorization of IP ranges to be understood. Instead of ""192.168.44.0/27"" you can write ""domain-controller-net"" in the policy (of course if you defined the object), and everybody that has to read the policy is happier

2) re-IP servers without manually changing the policies, just by modifying the corresponding object. 

**BIG CAVEAT** here: if you re-IP a server on a range that falls within another zone, you're typically SOL and you have to manually change policies. Traffic between different zones is by default blocked, and you end up staring at a configuration that seems good and asking yourself ""why doesn't it work?... Oh wait, the zone is wrong"".

You can set up object groups, to make policies even more readable and flexible. You can also define application groups (for example: all the ports required for NFS).

**Session timeouts**. Firewalls are stateful devices, so they have to keep a session table. When the session timeout expires, the firewall usually closes the TCP session.
This can be a problem, especially during low traffic times. 

There are all kinds of issues that can happen because of this, including [not being able to access your Outlook address book](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/db5a69ef-b099-4b46-b8c9-b1f15d30e3f2/address-book-the-connection-to-the-microsoft-exchange-server-is-unavailable?forum=exchangesvrgenerallegacy).

In most cases, default session timeouts are fine, but keep in mind special cases like databases or Exchange.

As always, there's a tradeoff. Setting up high session timeouts means DoS attacks on the firewall (by exhausting its resources) are easier.
However, you can mitigate this risk by properly configuring DoS protection on the firewall.

#**High availability**

Asymmetric routing is notoriously bad, especially when hitting stateful devices like firewalls.
As a result, active/standby is the standard way to handle firewall HA.

Active/active is not supported by all devices, sometimes certain features are not supported, sometimes you have to ask your vendor, so it's certainly not a solution out-of-the-box.

When you do need active/active, things get more complex because you have to avoid, or at least manage, asymmetric routing.

Common approaches rely on:

- active/active as a combination of two active/standby groups with inverted priorities. Let's say you have firewalls A and B. With this approach, you set up two HA groups.

Group 1: master = A, slave = B. 
Group 2: master = B, slave = A.

- session synchronization between the two firewalls. In this way, even if a packet actually travels asymmetrically, both firewalls have the same information, so nothing wrong should happen.
A caveat here is that, depending on how often you synchronize session state and when that packet actually arrives, you may still have some issues.

If you're doing Active/Active and your firewalls also act as default gateways, you also have to introduce a way to manage ARP.

Again, there are two approaches to this:

1) you share ARP among the firewalls based on some load-balancing mechanism, and use gratuitous ARP in case of failure (Palo Alto, ""ARP load sharing""), or

2) you prevent ARP requests from hitting the other data center. ARP traffic is broadcast, so you can benefit from BUUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast) suppression techniques used by OTV, EVPN, and so on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ffblzq/ysk_about_firewalls_and_how_they_work/,YSK about firewalls and how they work,,521,67,0.96

**Sally Floyd, Who Helped Things Run Smoothly Online, Dies at 69**  

*In the early 1990s, Dr. Floyd was one of the inventors of Random Early Detection, which continues to play a vital role in the stability of the internet.*  

By Katie Hafner  
Sept. 4, 2019  

Sally Floyd, a computer scientist whose work in the early 1990s on controlling congestion on the internet continues to play a vital role in its stability, died on Aug. 25 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69.  

Her wife, Carole Leita, said the cause was metastatic gall bladder cancer.  

Dr. Floyd was best known as one of the inventors of Random Early Detection, or RED, an algorithm widely used in the internet. Though not readily visible to internet users, it helps traffic on the network flow smoothly during periods of overload.  

The internet consists of a series of linked routers. When computers communicate with one another through the internet, they divide the information they intend to exchange into packets of data, which are sent to the network in a sequence. A router examines each packet it receives, then sends it on to its intended destination. But when routers receive more packets than they can handle immediately, they queue those packets in a holding area called a buffer, which can increase the delay in transmitting data.  

Moreover, the buffer has a limited capacity, so if the router continually receives traffic at a higher rate than it can forward, at some point it will discard incoming traffic.  

For all their ingenuity, the creators of the internet did not foresee some of the difficulties that arose as the network grew.  

“Before Sally, the working of network traffic mechanisms wasn’t completely understood,” said Eddie Kohler, a computer scientist at Harvard University and a longtime colleague of Dr. Floyd’s. “And as the internet expanded through the 1980s and began carrying much more traffic, that lack of understanding had real consequences.”  

Well into the 1980s, the internet frequently experienced a period of huge degradation in performance known as a congestion collapse. Here the network’s capacity was consumed by computers repeatedly transmitting packets, which routers were forced to discard because of overload.  

Dr. Floyd’s Random Early Detection was an enhancement of work done in the 1980s by Van Jacobson, a computer scientist whose scheme for signaling computers to slow down is often credited with saving the internet from collapse in the ’80s and ’90s. Dr. Floyd and Dr. Jacobson developed RED together.  

“With RED, a router would generate a signal saying, ‘I’ve got enough backlog that I’m going to tell senders I’m backed up,’” said Vern Paxson, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who collaborated on research with Dr. Floyd. This meant that by discarding the occasional data packet earlier, routers could often avoid getting completely clogged.  

“The work required a lot of careful mathematics and the development of simulations,” said Dr. Paxson, whom Dr. Floyd mentored when he was a graduate student at Berkeley.  

One byproduct of Dr. Floyd’s work reflected her passion for keeping things fair to all internet users. “Her work on congestion control was about keeping it working for everyone,” Dr. Kohler said. “For people with fast connections, and for people with slow connections.”  

Since the paper describing RED was published in 1993, it has been cited in more than 9,100 articles. “That’s truly huge,” Dr. Paxson said, “up there with the most fundamental papers in computer networking.”  

Sally Jean Floyd was born on May 20, 1950, in Charlottesville, Va. Her father, Edwin, was a mathematician at the University of Virginia; her mother, Marguerite (Stahl) Floyd, was an operating room nurse.  

She spent a year at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1969. She received a bachelor’s degree in sociology in 1971, with a minor in mathematics.  

Seeking a way to support herself after college, Dr. Floyd took a two-year course in electronics at Merritt College, a community college in Oakland, Calif. In 1975 she became a computer systems engineer for Bay Area Rapid Transit, known as BART.  

It was while working for BART that Dr. Floyd began to think about pursuing theoretical computer science, Ms. Leita, her wife, said. “She got curious,” she said. “The math genes she inherited kicked in.” Dr. Floyd’s brother, William, is a professor emeritus of mathematics at Virginia Tech.  

Dr. Floyd returned to Berkeley in 1984 and received a master’s degree and then, in 1989, a Ph.D. there, both in computer science. With the rapidly growing internet seizing her interest, she joined the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1990.  

In an interview for James Kurose and Keith Ross’s book “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” (2000), Dr. Floyd said it was Dr. Jacobson who first got her interested in computer network algorithms in the 1980s.  

“I hadn’t necessarily planned to stay in networking for years,” she said. “But for me, network research is more satisfying than theoretical computer science. I find I am happier in the applied world, where the consequences of my work are more tangible.”  

In 1999 she joined the International Computer Science Institute, a research organization affiliated with UC Berkeley, as a research scientist. She retired in 2009 after receiving a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  

Dr. Floyd met Ms. Leita, a reference librarian, in 1983. They married in 2013, soon after the United States Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California. In addition to Ms. Leita and her brother, Dr. Floyd is survived by a sister, Judith Floyd.  

Dr. Floyd eschewed the limelight in her field.  

“In the internet community, where arguments were often loud and long, Sally was the gentlest of souls,” said Deborah Estrin, a computer science professor at Cornell Tech in Manhattan. “Her response to comments that she disagreed with strongly was often a simple ‘huh,’ gently said and left hanging in the air.”  

Dr. Floyd was also known for showing interest in the work of graduate students, whom she often met at technical conferences.  

“Perhaps the most enduring scene is rounding some corner in a random hotel somewhere in the world and seeing Sally sitting on the floor chatting with a graduate student she’d met a few minutes beforehand about the student’s work,” Mark Allman, a longtime colleague, wrote in a recent online post. “That scene played out countless times.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/d04l5w/sally_floyd_coinventor_of_random_early_detection/,"Sally Floyd, co-inventor of Random Early Detection has died.",,468,28,0.98

q6mf87,networking,1634046011.0,"Just like the title says, this is some hopefully helpful info from my experience. YMMV.

**Networking background**: expired CCNA, 5yrs managing regional K12 network. Cisco/Aruba/Palo. very basic hub/spoke topology, minimal redundancy, vanilla EIGRP. decent experience in ISP/DC/access networking, but nothing crazy. No public cloud experience.

**Automation background**: no formal CS training. tinkered with batch files and TI Basic in HS, wrote some PHP/JS in a former life. started with /u/ktbyers' python for network engineers course about 5yrs ago. basic netmiko led to building a toy framework for automation (think nornir but waaay worse :) focused on doing everything programmatically even if it meant taking longer than by hand. implemented a freeztp provisioning pipeline. branched out into native APIs w/ Solarwinds orion (powerorion) and Palo Alto for a particularly complex firewall change. started ansible about 3 months ago, mostly to see how ""everyone else"" does automation, but then found I really liked the native cisco modules for desired state config.

**For my portfolio:** I got permission from my employer to push my work to github. This was its own great learning experience. I realize this is uncommon and most employers would not allow this. If so, I highly recommend building a github in your off hours, as my work there came up in almost every interview.

About 6 months before my job search, I started a linkedin. took my time building that w/ all relevant details & also dusted off the ol' resume, added all the automation stuff I did. when I started my job search in earnest, I searched linkedin for ""network engineer"", left location blank, and hit the ""remote"" flag. Applied to anything that even remotely interested me or seemed like it might be a good fit. applied to ""senior"" roles, and also searched for ""network automation engineer"". sent out 20-30 applications & changed my profile to ""looking for work.""

responses trickled in at first. didn't take long before I had multiple recruitment offers a day. within 2 weeks I had a full calendar of interviews, some from large-but-mostly-unknown companies, a startup, one from a fortune 50, and even one from a very well known social networking service.

**Interviews:**

* All of them start with a screening call from the recruiter, usually 10-15 mins.
* After that, it changed based on the job. Two of them went straight into a live coding interview using [coderpad.io](https://coderpad.io). Gave me 1-1.5hrs to solve 1-2 problems in python3. google is allowed & the interviewers were helpful, not giving the answers away of course, but steering me in the right direction. overall a great experience, seemed very real-world and relevant to the job.
* for the next round, the startup and another one then launched into a marathon of 4-5 back to back interviews, total time \~5hrs. I met with peer engineers, engineers from other teams, all the way up to VPs. it was exhausting and IMO kind of a waste of time. The fortune50 crammed all that into a single interview with 4-5 guys at once, seemed like a way better use of time.
* Final round is usually a short recap with the recruiter

After landing interviews with 5 places, I declined further recruiter emails. 20+ hours of interviews is plenty for me & a few really interesting prospects came up.

**Results**:

* The startup declined to make an offer, citing my lack of BGP experience. This makes sense as their product is a way of optimizing global internet performance. the recruiter apologized because she knew I didn't have BGP experience, but thought I could mentor underneath some senior guys. she didn't realize that wasn't possible for this particular role.
* A private nationwide company made an offer right away. on the lower end of the pay scale but overall awesome-sounding team & interesting role (I started out interviewing for a neteng role, but ended up in a SRE role, doing high level integrations/optimizations across the whole tech stack)
* Well Known Social Networking Company also made a (better) offer. this role is working with automated deployment/tshoot of caching appliances.
* Fortune50 is my favorite, a very popular entertainment company. recruiter says to expect a response today.
* Global Fintech company is also working on an offer
* Expecting one more offer from a hospitality/booking company this week

I was totally unprepared for this response. Once I saw the positive feedback I put in my notice at $currentjob. Thankfully my manager was super cool about letting me interview during this time.

**Stuff I did right:**

* put a lot of real, working code on github
* refined my elevator speech of who I am and what I do
* declined to state a salary range. told them ""I don't have a number in mind"" or ""My salary needs are flexible"" or ""I want to wait and see what kind of value I can add to the team before making that judgment."" The first offer I got was a 30% pay increase, and Fortune50/fintech is looking like a 50% increase.
* Learn ansible. holy shit I'm glad I dove into that because everyone does ansible. It's a PITA to set up (took me at least 1 full day to just get working) and it's slow as fuck, but it's the defacto standard and I would have not gotten past the second round if I didn't have that experience.
* API experience with Palo/NMS/REST
* lots of linux experience
* asked for extra time on coding interview due to my ADHD/Aspergers.

**Stuff I would do different:**

* learn public cloud networking (azure, AWS). at least as common as ansible.
* CCNP (or at least solid understanding of iBGP/eBGP). came up multiple times, thankfully a few are OK that I don't know it yet
* better pure python skills. I almost choked a few times on the coding interviews because my skills are focused on netdevops. there are a ton of holes in my foundational knowledge I need to shore up. [hackerrank.com](https://hackerrank.com) has a bunch of challenges that I started & plan to continue.
* learn terraform, also very common
* take notes during interviews. they all blur together so it's hard to remember what's what.

Cheers!

Also, it has a MAC address from a manufacturer called GemTek, which makes Wireless ISP devices.

I was playing around with node/express/react and thought I'd create a website for a couple of network tools I use:


https://stormcontrol.net

There's a tools for 

* IPv4 Subnetting

* Converting between binary/decimal/hex

* Converting between bits/bytes 

* DNS

* WhoIs 

* BGPv4 prefix lookup (I know this isn't the most useful, just playing around with their API).
 

Warning it's not mobile friendly because honestly I rarely need these tools when I'm away from a computer and if I did need it I'd prefer an app anyway (at least that's my excuse).

Running it in a docker container on a $5 Linode VPS because why not. Pretty fun actually. One docker container for the site, another for a reverse NGINX proxy and another container for automatically issuing Lets Encrypt certs. Using Cloudflare as a CDN.

I would suggest saving it somewhere that gets backed up. 

This morning I upgraded a switch (with saved configuration) and when it rebooted, it wiped all the VLANs.

The course is fundamentally about Python, but told with a network engineer's bent (i.e. the examples and exercises are more relevant to network engineers). Later in the course we also get into some more networking specific topics (Netmiko and Jinja2...well Jinja2 isn't really networking specific).

The course format is a lesson a week for eight weeks. The lessons are all delivered via email and consist of videos, exercises, and additional content. The course is self-paced.

The weekly lesson breakdown is as follows:

* Week1 - Why Python, the Python Interpreter Shell, and Strings
* Week2 - Numbers, Files, Lists, and Linters
* Week3 - Conditionals and Loops
* Week4 - Dictionaries, Exceptions, and Regular Expressions
* Week5 - Functions and the Python Debugger
* Week6 - Netmiko Basics
* Week7 - Jinja2 Basics, Introduction to YAML and JSON, Complex Data Structures
* Week8 - Libraries, Package Installation, and Virtual Environments

Looks like Cisco was having meetings with Centripetal about their technology to detect malware through unencrypted portions of a packet without requiring the payload to be decrypted. 

Centripetal used an analytics engine based off netflow, and then tagged network traffic to be processed by stateless filters.

Cisco implemented a similar function in their IOS XE platform - tagging network packets by Group Tag Labels through ISE/Stealthwatch and filtering traffic based off it.

Cisco must also pay Centripetal Networks a 10 percent royalty on the Cat9k, ISR1k, ISR9k, and Encrypted Traffic Analytics (which was only available if you bought  Stealthwatch) over the next five years, with that percentage dropping to 5 percent for the subsequent three years. 

That's not a cheap punishment.

Another hilarious fact from the trial is that Cisco was forced to use Zoom for VC (Shock! Horror!) after they tried to argue in typical Cisco arrogance that Webex was more secure then Zoom. From a [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/10/06/cisco-fined-nearly-2-billion-as-trial-by-zoom-concludes/) article:

> The first virtual patent-infringement bench trial was held using Zoom after the judge rejected Cisco's arguments that it posed a security threat and using Cisco Webex software would be the safer alternative.

What an absolutely petty thing to require when you're being sued! Also, it's not like Cisco has ever had vulnerabilities in their Webex software.

I told them it was going to cost half a million dollars to fix, and they were like ""K"" and now I'm looking at some new core switches and a big honkin' firewall that I'm bringing online during a three-day outage starting tomorrow.

And fucking hell I'm just a jangly ball of nerves.  I'm taking the entire company offline to do this cut-over/migration, everything is going hard down. Everything. My checklist is like a hundred items long, I've got a preemptive case open with Palo Alto, I've got detailed visio diagrams for exactly what gets plugged into where, the commands are already written and ready to be pasted into the switches, I've got the fiber run and the SFPs are in place (just waiting for me to push them in and no shut the interfaces), I've got some pro services on standby in case anything goes wrong.

But fuck fuck fuck man there's still so much I don't know.  Like I spent most of yesterday re-watching the OSPF lab videos from my old CCNA course, and I'm pretty sure it all should work the way I think it will but maybe I missed some kind of really obscure command somewhere.  There's a LOT of stuff going on in our edge firewalls (both set up by ""that guy"" three engineers ago who didn't document a single thing and even Palo Alto has looked at the configs and been like ""wow . . . he's doing some weird stuff with the Policy Based Forwarding"") that I've only halfway got a handle on.  I had to spend like a solid week going through the configs menu by menu and every day I was finding something new that I was like ""Oh, wow.  Yeah that would have fucked me if I don't change that during the migration"".  Even today I was STILL finding things!  Like the fact that our Service Route Configuration has the firewall getting updates through one of the other VLAN interfaces that I'm planning on removing (rather than the management interface like they usually do).  Gotta remember to change that, add it to the list.  Now there's 101 things on my checklist of things to do.

I don't know how I'll be able to sleep tonight.  I've been obsessively planning every step of this process for the last three months and now it's just one day away and it's kinda like when you're a kid and Christmas is the next day?  Like man, I just want to be hitting ""go"" on all this stuff already!  But then it's tempered by the impending sense of dread that I'm going to reconfigure it all and get it all patched in and nothing's going to work and I'll be caught in a routing loop somewhere and I'll end up in the fetal position crying on the floor of the datacenter.

DHCPv6, like DHCPv4, is commonly used in enterprise networks for connecting devices.

For the last six years — including through five new major versions of Android — that request has languished, when this week it was marked as ""Won't Fix (Intended Behavior)"" by Google engineer Lorenzo Colitti.

First of all thanks everyone for the constant updates to this outage. It’s been about 20 hours since this started happening. I’m hopeful this will be resolved later tonight (MST) CenturyLink has confirmed an ETR anywhere between 2-4hrs.

I was going to look into at RFC 1149 and 2549 (IPoAC) as an alternative but maybe I’ll wait a little longer. 😉

**Update: 12-28-2018 1355 UTC**

It sounds like things are coming back online slowly from CTL although multiple disruptions are still happening progress is being made. Take the the read-only Friday seriously today! We might hear more information later on what caused this and as others and news reports have said emergency services were and maybe still affected by this.

**Update: 12-29-2018 0238 UTC**

CTL posted another update via Twitter 0210 UTC; 

>CenturyLink has been dealing with a network event. All consumer services impacted by this event, including voice and 911, have been restored. Any latency issues will clear in the next few hours.

Hopefully that is the last one, what a mess, as others and news reports have said the FCC will be looking into this. Unable to call emergency services becomes a life threatening event. Being a responsible service provider when dealing with these types of provided services there has to redundancies in place. 

The way it sounds like is eventually everything runs over some type of overlay network and those nodes seem to share a management/common control plane (one failure domain) and if those nodes go down because of management/shared control plane reachability issues, traffic flooding, or some other impacting event on this domain, the whole system goes down...

We have a pair of Dell N3224P-ON switches and today's morning my colleague gave me a task and instructions to remove some unused VLANs. I'm sure I removed the correct VLANs. When I saved the configuration, everything stopped working and now we don't know what to do. We already rebooted both switches, we tried serial port access (always present Authentication Failed message) we tried to reset all the settings and restore from a backup, but the restore operation failed with a series of invalid commands (It seems that when it was taken, the equipment was running another firmware version, I don't know even if it belongs to those switches). I'm devasted because my manager took the responsibility and the CTO said he will fire him if things aren't fixed and running as before until 10 PM. The company is down right now (800+ employees). We contacted Dell support but they said that they can't do anything (the contract expired 4 months ago) so my manager and I decided to pay someone to fix it. We contacted the company that sold it and they said that Dell deployed the Switches and the guy that used to support our environment. (Nick) left the company and that he had the documentation of our network. We contacted him and he said that he can only help us after 6 P.M. I know the VLANs that existed before and their IDs and also the VLAN interfaces that existed before. If I anticipate the VLAN creation, can Nick fix it in 4 hours? My colleagues said that it is better that we don't do anything and that Nick is the best and will fix it quickly, but I'm afraid. I have no choice other than also ask to leave if my manager is fired.

Update: Nick asked the company where he worked to regain some access (used to be our MSP that provided support on the network) and they had all the documentation and old backups monthly of those switches (the last one was taken about 5 months ago, just before he left the MSP) but no one found it or at least no one wanted to find it because it seems that this relation didn't end in good terms. It seems that I've messed up with a transit VLAN. I've done it to one of the switches and didn't notice that it wasn't working anymore and after that, I did the same on the unit that was keeping things running.

c1yhwq,networking,1560837444.0,"Once upon a time, I was helping a customer troubleshoot some connectivity issues to my employer's cloud services. I was logging into looking glass servers for every tier 1 carrier in the path and getting frustrated that the little tier 2/3 shops didn't have their own looking glasses for me to use, forcing me to make educated guesses about how traffic being routed within their network.

Then I started to look inward, and thought to myself, ""well, why don't I have a looking glass for my own network?"". I began looking into some open source options and came up a bit disappointed. The most actively maintained, feature-rich, and well-documented project is easily [respawner/looking-glass](https://github.com/respawner/looking-glass), which does look like an excellent project. However, I was looking for something with a Python backend, and a highly customizable front end. Sadly, all the Python-based options on github were either extremely basic, platform-specific, or not actively maintained.

So, as a network engineer with no programming education or experience whatsoever, I thought it would be a great idea to dive straight into developing a complicated web application to get my feet wet! `# end sarcasm`

~2 months later at about 02:30 local time today, I finally made [hyperglass](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass) available to ""the masses"", and I'm excited to share it with the community. hyperglass is a modern looking glass application, written completely in Python 3, that is intended to be too easy not to deploy (getting up and running should take no more than 10 minutes). For ""traditional"" network devices, Netmiko is used for SSH connection handling. For you edgy folks out there using FRRouting on Linux, I also built a little API called [hyperglass-frr](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass-frr) which runs on the Linux hosts and executes commands on behalf of hyperglass.

hyperglass also includes some neat features, such as IP/prefix blacklisting, query rate-limiting, response caching, and Prometheus metrics (Grafana dashboard also included!). I built the front-end on the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework, which is extremely lightweight, [pretty](https://imgur.com/KpdUr6G), and requires very little JavaScript (which makes me want to vomit). Supported query types are BGP Route, BGP Community, BGP AS Path, Ping, and Traceroute (any of which can be disabled). Almost everything application-wide is completely customizable - from the colors, fonts, and UI text of the front end to the SSH commands, error messages, and features on the back end, almost everything can be enabled, disabled, or changed via a simple TOML config file (all of which is [documented](https://hyperglass.readthedocs.io/)).

I welcome any feedback from network engineers and programmers alike, and look forward to working with the community on improving hyperglass even more. My very lofty goal is that network operators out there will begin implementing looking glasses to help the rest of the network operators out there do their jobs better, ultimately making the internet work better (ever so slightly).

f6g7cd,networking,1582141632.0,"A couple years ago I made [this rambling post](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/7zauql/i_tricked_a_company_into_paying_me_too_much_for_a/) regarding my feelings a few months into starting a new job.  I'd gone from a junior position in a large enterprise to being the sole network person for a small company, and the transition was jarring.

&nbsp;

Since that post, things have gotten much better. I've done a complete [core replacement and network rebuild](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/a02aat/update_i_shut_down_my_company_over_thanksgiving/), built out a new satellite office location from scratch, survived my first [core switch failure](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/db25se/1yearagome_just_saved_my_ass_aka_babbies_first/), and cleaned up/re-patched some of the most confusing [IDF closets that I'd ever seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportgore/comments/dtoexp/tonight_i_finally_get_to_unplug_and_repatch_this/).  Aside from the actual network parts of the job, I've also rolled out Zoom across the whole company, brought our MDM system online for phone provisioning (which reduced the tickets to our helpdesk by like 40%), and neurotically documented an organization that previously had little more than a verbal history passed down through the ages.

&nbsp;

And most recently (just a few weeks ago in fact) I passed the final exam (TSHOOT) to earn my CCNP, which was the culmination of almost a year of non-stop studying and labbing.  It's a point of pride and something that I'm very glad I did, but also intimidating because the more I learn the more I realize that I *don't* know.

&nbsp;

And going through the process of studying for my CCNP also made me realize that . . . I think I'm done with this job.  It's not a *bad* job by any stretch of the imagination, but maybe 50% of my time is spent on actual networking and we're not big enough that I'll ever get to use most of the technologies that I was studying while prepping for the exams.  I'm proud of the time I've spent here; I was able to take a place that was held together with undocumented duct tape and I can leave them with a documented, supportable and scalable network that should continue serving their needs for years in the future.  But as I look at the future of the company, I don't foresee as many interesting challenges for my roll and there's limited growth potential.

&nbsp;

I think the biggest shortfall for this job is that I don't have any peers.  I'm lucky enough to not be the only IT guy (Someone else gets to deal with printers, thankfully), but I am the only network guy so I have no one to confer with or bounce ideas off of.  In my old job I was one of 10 on the network team, and I miss being in that kind of collaborative environment where I could really learn from others and develop a solid understanding of what the best practices are and why they're the best practices. 

&nbsp;

So I suppose this post is mostly a thank-you to this community for the support over the last couple of years, and perhaps some guidance on where I should be looking next. Another large enterprise, perhaps?  I fell like something with 3,000-5,000 users is going to be an ideal sweet spot of being able to touch a wide range of tech and able to have co-workers that you can talk shop with, while hopefully avoiding the pitfalls of bureaucracy that I previously dealt with in government work. I'd *love* to work at someplace like Cloudflare where networking is at the core of what they do (and they do have an SF office), but I haven't seen them hiring for my type of roll in quite a while and I'm not sure I have the dev chops to cut it in a modern tech company.

&nbsp;

Where would you guys suggest I go from here?

g1rncd,networking,1586956363.0,"One day I was randomly looking at our arp tables and CDP/LLDP neighbors. Mostly hoping to find whatever needs upgrading. And then it stuck out, a horrendously outdated AP. Has not been updated since 2011. This was even before the guys that were at my company before me.

It was not pingable, all ports were closed and it was only visible via CDP and only on other devices that were close by. None of my passwords worked. The hostname was a very descriptive 'Router 1'.

Worst of all this device defied everything on how we usually configure devices and several of our policies. I just had to go down that rabbit hole.

Well, I start tracking down its mac address in arp tables until I come to a Linksys. A Linksys SPS enterprise switch. Anyone remember those before they were absorbed into Ciscos SBS lineup? And there it was, an interface with a description containing the customers name.

I ask my boss/CEO whether he knows anything about them and he is like, who are they? Then we ask accounting if they are still paying us. Turns out yes they are and their payments are very regular. Exemplary even. My boss is actually pretty nice most of the time so I don't mind(and usually des not make mistakes like these).

Nothing, I call the client and ask to get an IT person which I eventually get. I ask him to reset our password(luckily he had an admin account as well on the device) and we arrange an appointment for my visit to them so I can upgrade that old beast. Turns out they have been trying to contact us as well on our old contacts.

Eventually  the date came and it was a 2 hour job stepping it trough updates and being careful that nothing breaks. Luckily everything worked out fine. I enabled remote management, did some cleanups and everything was just fine.

udthd4,networking,1651147719.0,"As a followup to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/q6mf87/how_i_landed_multiple_offers_for_100_remote/), I wanted to share some of what I learned so far, being the only network automation engineer in a fortune500.

1. **Networking roles aren't going anywhere**. If you're an even half-competent networker, your job is safe. At the very least, automation isn't going to take it away, it's only going to make it easier. The more I lean into the dev side, the less I know/care/have time for actual network engineering. My neteng background was more a prerequisite for a completely different role. I'm not a 'hybrid' network engineer/software developer except in only the narrowest technical sense. I'm a software developer with (critically important) network engineering experience. I lean on our CCIE/CCNA/JNCIA engineers for all the real networking. I'm their air support. the man with the magic wand that helps make their jobs easier and bring things together so they don't drown in an ever-growing ocean of manual processes.
2. **Network engineers should stay network engineers unless you want to change roles or take on a double-major**. Corollary to #1. I know this sounds like heresy on a couple levels, but hear me out. automation is its own world full of lightsabers and the Force and god help you if you don't know how to wield them properly. thinking programmatically is \*critical\* to not blowing your shit up, even with tools like ansible that hold your hand the whole way. Just like you wouldn't want me fucking with your BGP or vxlan, I don't want you fucking with my automation. It's just too dangerous. I used to be a fan of every engineer becoming an automation engineer. That is NOT advisable. they are two very different problem spaces with two very different ways of thinking. it takes a rare unicorn indeed to keep a CCIE-level grasp of networking and a Jedi-level grasp of automation in his head (think David Barroso, Kirk Byers, etc). Expecting every neteng to do that is not only improbable but it's inviting disaster. That said: if you \*want\* to learn automation to change roles, or are prepared to take it on as a double-major (not just another checkbox), I fully support that! Just be sure to learn in a safe place and take it slow. Great power / great responsibility and all that.
3. **There is huge opportunity in network automation.** I guess this is obvious, but it wasn't obvious to me just how big the opportunity is. I make as much (or more) than an typical CCIE, with a CCNA background. I effectively lead my own department. Neteng jobs may not be going anywhere, but a new world of opportunity to make $$$$$ and do awesome shit is right there for those willing to build the skillset.
4. **The DevOps aspect of NetDevOps is 90% of it.** It's not enough to learn python and git. That was enough to get me in the door, but it's definitely not enough to keep things rolling. Those who advised me to learn terraform and docker and CI/CD were right. That and webdev skills are almost mandatory, at the very least, a solid grasp of HTTP/REST and how to interact with it programmatically. Even better if you know html/css/js/sql. Oh and Linux skills are a must. Bottom line, this role is exactly what it sounds like: devops applied to network engineering. Somehow in my head I dismissed that, or didn't fully grasp what that meant until now. I need to become a fully competent devops engineer to succeed and I'm already feeling the growing pains of not having a solid devops background.

that's all I can think of for now, cheers!

ev5z6z,networking,1580220181.0,"Obligatory this happened about a week ago, and this is a throwaway account.  I had actually been debating on even posting this or not, once the initial sting and depression wore off, and decided I'm going to do so.

I think first I need to start with a little background about myself.  I am a network engineer with 15 years of experience in enterprise.  I have a CCNP, but never went after CCIE (like many of you here, I imagine.)  I've spent my entire career doing route/switch/firewall, again like many of you here.

Over the last two years, I took a hard look at all the warnings online and otherwise that we network engineers should learn to code.  It'll save us from going ""extinct.""

Automation is coming to take our jobs.  Dev Ops is coming to take our jobs.  Infrastructure as Code is coming to take our jobs.

We've all heard it.

I took it to heart.  After over a decade working in the field, I had never once learned to script or code, not even basic stuff.  No powershell, no bash, no python, no ANYTHING.  I never even wrote so much as an EEM script in IOS!

So to put it mildly, these warnings put a pretty strong scare into me.  I was ill-equipped to deal with a future where my skills could become irrelevant long before I became retirement age.

So in response, I set off on a journey to learn to code.  I know that sounds silly, but it's exactly what I did.  I poured over online books and forums, reading constantly about the different languages out there, and I chose Python, because it seemed to be the one that comes up in conversation the most.

Now what did I do?  I bought books, I bought VODs, and training.  I took classes on UDEMY, I took Cisco's NETACAD courses, I signed up for K Byers ""Python for Network Engineers"" course.  I even created a new reddit account just for asking questions on various python and dev type subreddits.  I poured my time and energy into this.

And it paid off!  Or so I thought.  In less than a year, actually just a few months really, I was ""scripting like a mad man.""  I made tons of scripts at my job place.  Now even my coworkers do certain tasks by running my scripts to fulfill work orders.  My scripts have become part of DR plans and continuity binders.  Needless to say, I was feeling pretty good about myself.

My crowning achievement was a network OS upgrade automation script.  It would log into the IP, determine what model the device was, pull the appropriate code from our FTP server, and then run pre and post checks.  It would grab all the routing neighbors, number of routes in the RIB, and the next hop for all those routes, write them to variables, perform the upgrade, and then do a post-check afterwards.  Differences it found were immediately drafted into an email and sent out to us.

For the first time ever in my company's history, we performed IOS & NX-OS upgrades without anyone even being AWAKE for them.  We felt confident enough to schedule it late at night and just wake up to the results the next day.

So, feeling a little big for my britches, I decided it was time to challenge my newfound skills in an environment that would have more demand for them.  So I put my feelers out and started looking for jobs that focused on coding and automation of network infrastructure.

For being in a major metropolitan area, I came up surprisingly dry.  But then it came in like a beacon.  A recruiter (a headhunter really) contacted me about an opportunity at a Fortune 500 that was looking for a ""NetDevOps Engineer.""  He explained to me that they were really looking for a networking expert that could help coders adapt to this new dynamic.  He shared the REQ and I'll be 100% honest, it read like a Network Engineering REQ.  

They wanted proven skills and experience managing an enterprise network.  They wanted expert knowledge of routing protocols and standard configurations.  They wanted the ability to troubleshoot and isolate network faults.

Any mention of python, code, or programming in general, other than the title of the REQ, was just in passing.

It sounded like the dream job to me.  I was not expected to be an ""expert programmer.""  I was expected to be a good network engineer first, with a focus on automating and coding this all.

I began reading about Infrastructure as code and had dreams of a long and successful career.  ""This is the future"" I thought, and I was going to be smack dab in the middle of it.

To prepare for the Interview I poured over the technologies listed in the job REQ.  My recruiter reassured me that they were mainly looking for a networking guy, who knew python and had written a few scripts on the side.  So that's what I prepared for.

Then came the interview.  And it. Went. HORRIBLE.  I was totally unprepared, and I left there feeling humiliated and knowing I did not get the job.

I was taken completely off guard by the interview.  It did not ask a single question about routing protocols or networking really in general.  Instead it started out hot and heavy about coding and development concepts.  Stuff that I, as a network engineer who had self-taught himself python, knew absolutely NOTHING about.

I'll try to recount the questions I was asked as best as I can but honestly it was just a blur:

- How do you manage source control?  Something about ""single source of truth.""

- Tell me about how you manage branching, pull requests, bugs and hotfixes?

- How have you integrated unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing?

- Tell us about linting your code.

- Does your code closely follow PEP8?

- How have you optimized ""oh one complexity, and oh N complexity?""

- How have you achieved a repeatable and sustainable code base?  Tell us about your SDLC pipeline.

By the end of this interview, my face must have been beat red.  I tried to work in a few examples of how my scripts had increased efficiency in our environment, and how a solid foundation of networking protocols was I would bring to the table, but they didn't want to hear about any of that.

The most painful part of this was that even after I had showed I was mostly clueless about any of what they were asking (and I didn't try to lie and stumble through stuff.  I just said my experience lay elsewhere and I wasn't familiar with the concept, etc.) they STILL kept pouring on the questions.  It was like a dumpster fire.

It's been over a week now and I haven't heard back from the company nor even the recruiter who had initially contacted me.  He hasn't even returned my calls.

So I just wanted to get this all off my chest and rant for a bit.  If you've spent most of your career as a network engineer, and you suddenly think you're going to turn around and ""learn to code"" and go to a place like that, I think it's a pipe dream my friends. 

These seem like life long crafts.  I felt like a caveman being asked these questions.  I can't even imagine how I could possibly get to where I currently am to where they wanted me to be.

Have you had similar experiences?  Am I letting one bad experience discourage me too much?  Because from where I'm sitting right now, I feel like I need to go crawl into a hole somewhere.  I got a brief glimpse into a world far more advanced than the one I've been living in, and I felt overwhelmingly that I wasn't cut out for being in that world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ev5z6z/learn_to_code_they_say_hah/,"Learn to code, they say.

nptmuv,networking,1622552888.0,"## TL;DR: 
- Wi-Fi 6E uses the same PHY standard, MIMO, and modulation rates from Wi-Fi 6. The only thing new is the 6 GHz spectrum.
- 6 GHz can be faster, if you’re near an AP using wide channels.
- 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz still have advantages, such as longer range, better wall penetration, and legacy compatibility.
---

Before we talk about the nature of 6 GHz Wi-Fi, it’s helpful to understand the components of Wi-Fi connections and how they interact to determine performance. Consumer routers claim numbers like 10,800 Mbps of throughput, but where does that number come from? Why are the numbers what they are, and why don’t I get 10,800 Mbps on my speed tests, dang it!?

### Start with 10,800 Mbps
- 2.4 GHz: 4x4, up to 1,200 Mbps with 40 MHz Channels
- 5 GHz: 4x4, up to 4,800 Mbps with 160 MHz Channels
- 6 GHz: 4x4, up to 4,800 Mbps with 160 MHz Channels

1,200 Mbps + 4,800 Mbps + 4,800 Mbps = 10,800 Mbps.

### Go Down to One Band
Since Wi-Fi connections only happen on a single band, you’re only able to access one band at a time. If you use 5 GHz or 6 GHz, you’re down to 4,800 Mbps. This is using 160 MHz channels, and 4 spatial streams.

### Limit MIMO to 2x2
[MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO) is a direct capacity multiplier, and it multiplies capacity using the same spectrum. While most high-end Wi-Fi 6 access points support 4x4:4 MIMO, the vast majority of client devices top out at 2 spatial streams. Battery operated Wi-Fi clients like your smartphone or laptop are almost all 2x2:2 devices.
Going from 4 streams to 2 streams cuts our maximum link rate from 4,800 Mbps to 2,400 Mbps, if using a 160 MHz channel.

### If Using 5 GHz, Set Channel Width to 80 MHz
Using 160 MHz channels in 5 GHz requires the use of DFS, and not all devices support DFS operation. 80 MHz channels are much more realistic option for 5 GHz, limiting maximum link rates to 1,200 Mbps.
With Wi-Fi 6E, you get access to 6 or 7 more 160 MHz channels, and don’t need to use AFC or DFS if operating indoors. Range is less though, since 6 GHz attenuates faster, wider channels increase background interference, and 6 GHz indoor low-power AP transmit power is limited. For more details, see the  [Device Class and EIRP Limit section of Wi-Fi 6E's Current Status](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/neg4ir/wifi_6es_current_status/).

### Set Modulation/Coding to 256-QAM or Lower
The maximum link rate requires 1024-QAM modulation, and a very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The highest data rates are only possible in the best situations, with an AP nearby and limited interference on the channel. A more realistic modulation is 256-QAM or 64-QAM, resulting in a maximum link rate in the range of 600-900 Mbps for 80 MHz 2x2, or 1,200 to 1,800 Mbps for 160 MHz 2x2. 

### TCP/IP Overhead
Even in wired networks, there’s around a 5% overhead in TCP/IP connections. That 5% comes from all the data that’s required to setup the connection and address the packets and frames being exchanged. Jumbo frames can help a bit here, but come with their own issues. See  [Wikipedia for more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo_frame#Bandwidth_efficiency). 

### Beacons and Management Traffic
Beacon frames are how an AP advertises networks to client devices. In order to ensure that all devices in range are able to understand them, access points send out management traffic such as beacon frames at the lowest supported data rates. This expands the range of the broadcasts, but also acts as a speed bump, consuming precious airtime. The amount of management traffic increases with additional SSIDs, and features such as beamforming.
You can limit the impact of management traffic by restricting minimum data rates. That’s usually only necessary in dense multi-AP networks, where small cell sizes and careful channel planning are important.

### Half-Duplex
Wi-Fi is half-duplex, meaning on one device can be transmitting at a time, and only in one direction. To make an analogy, Wi-Fi is a walkie talkie, not a phone call. Ethernet is full-duplex, and allows transmissions in both directions at the same time. Wi-Fi does not. 
Wi-Fi being half-duplex doesn’t mean that throughput is cut in half, but it does mean that Wi-Fi devices can’t multi-task. When downloading a large file, a client device has to take many short breaks to transmit TCP acknowledgement frames back to it’s AP, or to allow others to transmit. Wi-Fi devices can’t download and upload data at the same time, or talk when others are talking. 

### Wi-Fi is a Shared Medium: Collisions and Re-transmissions
In addition to being half-duplex, Wi-Fi is a shared medium. When one device is transmitting on a channel, all other devices in range must wait their turn. If multiple devices transmit at the same time a collision can occur, causing the transmissions to be jumbled. When collisions occur, devices need to wait for a random length of time before re-transmitting. This can also cause link rates to be lowered temporarily, resulting in lower effective throughput for everyone. 

### PHY Link Rate is an Estimate, and an Average
When you see a link rate of 1200 Mbps, that doesn’t mean every single frame gets sent at 1024-QAM modulation. Individual frames may get sent above or below the current link rate values. 

### In Summary
- **A 2x2 device on an 80 MHz channel can achieve a maximum link rate of 1200 Mbps**, resulting in throughput around 800-900 Mbps in ideal conditions.

- **A 2x2 device on a 160 MHz channel can achieve a maximum link rate of 2400 Mbps**, resulting in throughput around 1400-1600 Mbps in ideal conditions.

This isn’t even all of the factors. If you’re interested in reading more, [the CWNP blog has a great list of sources of overhead in Wi-Fi](https://www.cwnp.com/wi-fi-overhead-part-1-sources-of-overhead/) . 

# 6 GHz Wi-Fi Characteristics

There’s nothing special added in 6 GHz to reduce latency, or increase speeds. Wi-Fi 6E uses the same PHY standard, MIMO, and modulation rates from Wi-Fi 6. The only thing new is the 6 GHz spectrum. An 80 MHz channel in 5 GHz is going to perform essentially the same as an 80 MHz channel in 6 GHz, with a few caveats:

- Higher frequencies attenuate faster, so 6 GHz signals offer slightly less range than 5 GHz.
- Indoor, low-power 6E devices like the RAXE500 are limited to a slightly lower EIRP in the 6 GHz band compared to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- 6 GHz outdoor operation is more complicated, and regular-power outdoor APs require the use of the new AFC system, which is similar to DFS in 5 GHz. Standard-power APs will need to report their location before being able to operate at their full power.
- Indoor, low-power devices don’t need to worry about AFC or DFS. Combined with a big chunk of new spectrum, this makes 80MHz and 160 MHz channels more practical to use.

Maximum allowed transmit power in 6E increases with channel width. You’ll get the same 30 dBm maximum EIRP allowed in 5 GHz, but only with a 320 MHz wide channel. 320 MHz channels should be supported in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be), but for now 6 GHz indoor range will be less than the maximum possible with 5 GHz.
- 160 MHz channels reduce maximum allowed EIRP by 3 dB
- 80 MHz channels reduce maximum allowed EIRP by 6 dB
- 40 MHz channels reduce maximum allowed EIRP by 9 dB
- 20 MHz channels reduce maximum allowed EIRP by 12 dB

6 GHz offers more bandwidth and less interference. 6 GHz allows for up to seven 160 MHz channels or fourteen 80 MHz channels, making them much more usable in the real world. Because of this, **6 GHz can be faster, if you’re near an AP using wide channels. 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz still have advantages, such as longer range, better wall penetration, and legacy compatibility.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/nptmuv/understanding_wifi_speed_and_how_6_ghz_compares/,Understanding Wi-Fi Speed and How 6 GHz Compares,Wireless,342,39,0.98
cukpsl,networking,1566598016.0,"Ran into a problem at a customer site today that was unexpected. Thought y’all might appreciate it. 

Small office, 10ish people, for a scrap recycling operation. Consumer-grade switches, access points. The complaint they gave my dispatcher was that sometimes the wireless network went offline, sometimes the internet went out. 

Indeed, I join the wireless network to find I was not offered a dhcp lease. As I was explaining the possible causes to the most technical office worker, I got one randomly.

Logged into the consumer grade ap/router/switch to find that the access point had over 200 associations. A second later, 90. Then 140. 

Turns out this recycling plant also reconditions tablets and cellphones. They test them by getting them on the wireless and running through part of the setup to determine if they’re still logged into iCloud etc. 

Here’s the kicker: they do 500 phones an hour, and they don’t power them off when they’re done. They stay on until they run out of battery in totes of hundreds of phones. 

Every second, a bunch wake up, connect to wireless, do whatever heartbeats/mail check/whatever, then disassociate. The poor asus access point with a /24 to hand out to all the office machines... can have as many as 300 phones at any given second trying to associate and pull a lease.

&#x200B;

About 5 years ago I posted of me [passing my CCIE RS](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3ji2tu/ccie_passed/) which was a process that took the better part of 4 years to accomplish. Well, I got the official email today from Cisco that my CCIE has fully expired.

I renewed my CCIE once and struggled then to convince myself to go through with the re-cert. After I walked out of the testing center I told myself I would never renew my CCIE again. 

# Stance on certs

I know there is a mix bag of emotions and opinions around certs and I fall in the camp where I have seen tremendous growth in knowledge and my career from the certs I have completed.  My stance is, if they work for you and push you in the right direction then go for it. If not, then find another method that pushes you. 

Trying to improve your knowledge and  skills is NEVER wrong.

I have always been a strong supporter of the core Cisco certs (RS, SP) as they dont just teach a product, they teach the fundamental technologies. But that is slowly changing...

# Why let it go?

During those 4 years I set pretty much every other technology and focus aside to grind through my CCIE. And it was painful. I watched as SDN, Network Automation and new skills started to come into light and I set those aside to spend the day/week learning RIP or drilling deeper into SSM multicast. 

I knew when I finished my CCIE my focus was going elsewhere and just like the industry, it did. SDN really didn't make the impact we thought it would, but network automation made huge strides in the industry. No one talks about how they can improve their workflows of manually configuring switches.

Since I passed in 2015, I have not seen a single justifiable reason to set a considerable chunk of my time aside to prove I still know now to configure a Cisco network. Just like my college degree, my CCIE is a stepping stone or what I consider my foundational knowledge.

My certification journey played an immense role in getting me to where I am but it has little use right now and the time sink is not justifiable. 

# Looking Forward

If I had to guess, the network will not be any less important in 10 or 20 years. Hell, you still have to move packets. But it will take less to manage and be more tightly integrated with the full application and infrastructure stack. The Cloud and how it is used and operated is a prime example. 

Other hints into this are Kubernetes and NFV which are moving the network intelligence deeper into the server or application and away from the actual fabric. Companies like Celium are moving network control deep into the kernel and SmartNics are giving servers better network control.

 SD-WAN and wireless has already removed the complex configuration of tunnels and network segmentation away from the network operator and simplified the operations of of those areas of networking.

This is a trend that will not stop as customer demand on applications require it now. Hint the popularity of Cloud and containerization with app developers.

The network can not functions as a manually configured eco-system anymore. We either make this change or some other group in technology will do it for us.

I chose to help lead this change.

One of the nicest and most talented network engineers I have had the privilege of working with -- a redditor, and contributor to r/networking, Brandon Bernier, age 25, passed away this past Monday in a terrible car accident.


[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/v7p8f/the_next_few_months_of_my_life_unboxed_ready_to/) is a recent thread Brandon had here. He just finished this network and was already excited and thinking about finding new challenges. 


Brandon was extraordinarily talented for his age. He came to us at a time when we spent months looking for a new hire, and we all immediately agreed he was the perfect fit. Outside of networking he was extremely passionate about biking (the kind of guy who would inter-state bike hundreds of miles), and frequented many a reddit meetup, both in Chicago and San Francisco. All in all one of the nicest human beings I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

2wj91p,networking,1424427073.0,"Just to preface this post, I am a long time lurker of this subreddit, but never had the cahoonies to post about some of my experiences in the IT world. I am a pretty new system admin but have always had an interest in networking as one of my dream careers. As I have not seen to many posting about people's interview process with google, I figured it might be interesting to some out there if I shared my experience with those that are also looking for their first network gig. Please let me know if I am posting this in the wrong subreddit.


The google interview process for me started almost four months a go when I submitted my resume on the google website. I applied for the entry level NOC position that recommended 1-2 years in a enterprise support type role and was pursuing some of their entry level certs. This should be a cake walk I thought, already having my CCNA I felt like I was ready for anything they could throw at me.


Shortly after I submitted my resume with google, (roughly two weeks) I was contacted by one of their recruiters detailing what the job entailed and some basic screening question to see if I was up to snuff for google standards. The questions were pretty basic, and most of these questions were something you would see on a CCNA exam. As long as you understood how the OSI model worked and how to spit out some protocols and features this screening process was fairly basic and nothing to difficult.


After about a month I was contacted again for the next round of interviews. This round was with someone that was actually on the NOC team and lasted about an hour. This interview was purely technical and went as deep as the interviewer thought they needed to go to screen adequate candidates. All routing protocols, layer two protocols, HA protocols, and layer seven protocol questions were thrown at me in this interview. Anything and everything that this person over the phone could throw at me was fair game in this interview. I was sweating buckets by the end of this interview as maybe 30% of the questions they asked me I was unable to answer at all. I honestly thought I was eliminated at this point. I did not hear back from google for a while.


In January, I got a call back that they wanted to invite me for an onsite interview at their mountain view headquarters. Awesome I thought, as I began to stuff down the entirety of ""TCP/IP illustrated"" and ""Internetworking with TCP/IP"" as quickly as I possibly could in order to prepare for the interview of my life.


The interview process itself was 4 hours long with 4 different individuals, with a 1 hour lunch after the first two interviews. All I can say is that these interviews were one of the most difficult interviews I have ever sat in. Three of the four were purely technical to scope out how much I knew about networking. the fourth one was all the feely goody stuff to see how well you would fit culturally with google. 


All I can say about this interview is if you are not already a professional in the networking world. . .good luck.  They had me diagraming on a large white board, had me explain how I would troubleshoot a scenario that they provided, and lastly a whole sleuth of questions on the OSI model. After the interview, I felt emotionally and physically drained. It was like being put in the boxing ring against a pro boxer, but I have only been boxing in the minors for a week.


If I had any advice for a candidate that gets this far, make sure you really know your stuff.  Layers 1 through 4 in the OSI model should be burned into your brain, because you will get thrown around the ring if you don't have an intimate understanding of how these layers work.


Ultimately, I was not extended an offer, and it felt like google was looking for someone that had more of a CCNP level of knowledge for an entry level position. So what is google looking for? Is it your technical ability, or is it how you handle pressure that defines who they will hire in their interview process? I have no idea.  What I did take away from this is where I am lacking  in my networking skills, and what I need to study for future interviews. 


Thanks for reading my story and again let me know if you have any questions that are not too detailed. I hope it helped some of you budding network technicians out their that have hopes of working at google some day.

This was actually fixed about two weeks ago but I've been super busy.

My client spent thousands of dollars ($8-$10K?) of billable time to troubleshoot, work around, and ultimately fix this problem.

The trouble started in early November. We called Spectrum for help immediately, because we knew exactly what had changed: They replaced our cable modem and it broke our phones. It took four months to get this resolved. Dozens and dozens of calls. Hours and hours on hold.

I cannot express how worthless Spectrum support was. All attempts at getting the issue escalated were denied. Phone agents lied, saying they had opened dispatch requests when they had not. I was hung-up on countless times. We were told it was impossible for this kind of problem to be Spectrum's fault, over and over and over. Support staff engaged in tasteless blame shifting, psychological abuse, and a disturbing level of intentional human degeneracy that deserves no reservation of scorn. At no point did anyone who I ever interacted with display the technical competence to flip a burger properly, nevermind meet a level of sub-CCNA aptitude to understand anything I was telling them.

The one exception to my criticism of Spectrum's anti-support were the local technicians who came on-site to replace equipment. While it was obvious they were disempowered/neutered by Spectrum's corporate culture, they were respectful, patient, and as helpful as I think they could have been. I will reserve any further praise for them, however, for I'm sure they would be promptly fired should it be known by corporate that I had anything positive to say.

What it took to get Spectrum to finally fix it? Going to social media and publicly shaming them and dropping F-bombs in people's mailboxes until someone in corporate noticed.



Excerpts from my conversations with Spectrum:

""I can relay that the engineers identified a potential provisioning error that likely caused the issue you first identified, and they are investigating a fix""

""I get the impression that they were planning to push an update to the modem to correct the provisioning error. This should solve the VOIP / SIP traffic issue. I will provide an update when I have more information.""

""I just received an update from the network team. They identified the provisioning error on the modem that impacted VOIP traffic and corrected the error. We ask that you reboot the modem and test to ensure that VOIP traffic is no longer impacted. Once you are able to reboot and test, kindly let us know the result.""



We rebooted the cable modem and the rate-limit is totally gone now. Inbound port 5060 behaves like all other ports.

Also try `ping 0x7F000001`

You will get the same result

 

## Pure Decimal Notation

You can also do straight decimal: `ping 2130706433`

 
-----------
 

All these address expressions will also work in a browser: [http://2130706433](http://2130706433)

 

From the research I have done, this appears to be the case due to addresses being interpreted down to binary (using inet\_aton, inet\_addr, etc library functions), and then expressed to the user in standard (compressed) dot decimal.

So in effect, the system doesn't care about the format you use to input the number, it all becomes a binary number under the hood, then interpreted to a familiar format when shown to the user.

9rr381,networking,1540609157.0,"u/m1xed0s [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/9rka1m/is_there_still_a_way_to_download_ciscolive/) about how to download Cisco Live videos. Nobody had a great answer, and it turns out I was wrong-- `youtube-dl` couldn't download anything from https://ciscolive.cisco.com/on-demand-library/

So I took it as a challenge to write some python. Submitted the [pull request](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/17984) to the main repo, but I expect to take time before the code is merged.

As of 10/27/2018 @8am PDT, extractor now supports downloading all videos for a filter criteria (not just individual videos).

You do NOT have to log in to your Cisco account :)

You can wait for the merge, or run my branch directly:

**EDIT**: Working on support for downloading multiple videos based on filter criteria, e.g. [all 47 videos from Orlando 2018](https://ciscolive.cisco.com/on-demand-library/?search.technology=scpsTechnology_analytics&search.event=ciscoliveus2018#/) on the topic of Analytics & Automation

**EDIT2**: Latest commit includes support for downloading all videos in a given filter criteria. Check the boxes for the videos you want, then copy the URL to `youtube-dl`. Example from above to download all Orlando 2018 Technology & Analytics videos:

    python -m youtube_dl https://ciscolive.cisco.com/on-demand-library/?search.technology=scpsTechnology_analytics&search.event=ciscoliveus2018#/

It all passes unit tests but it's pretty fresh, let me know if you run into trouble :)

                                     download (minimum possible number of
                                     seconds to sleep) when used along with
                                     --max-sleep-interval.
    --max-sleep-interval SECONDS     Upper bound of a range for randomized sleep
                                     before each download (maximum possible
                                     number of seconds to sleep). Must only be
                                     used along with --min-sleep-interval.

If you run into bugs, run the `-v` option and copy the output into an issue on github.

**EDIT4** The latest snapshot prints the permalink for both the slidedeck and video player in the output. So if you want to reference the material directly, but not download the actual videos, you can pass `-s` (simulate) to `youtube-dl` and copy the output for future reference.

&nbsp;

        These features are new in 0.71 (released 2019-03-16):
        
    *     Security fixes found by an EU-funded bug bounty programme:
    *     a remotely triggerable memory overwrite in RSA key exchange, which can occur before host key verification
    *     potential recycling of random numbers used in cryptography
    *     on Windows, hijacking by a malicious help file in the same directory as the executable
    *     on Unix, remotely triggerable buffer overflow in any kind of server-to-client forwarding
    *     multiple denial-of-service attacks that can be triggered by writing to the terminal
    *     Other security enhancements: major rewrite of the crypto code to remove cache and timing side channels.
    *     User interface changes to protect against fake authentication prompts from a malicious server.
    *     We now provide pre-built binaries for Windows on Arm.
    *     Hardware-accelerated versions of the most common cryptographic primitives: AES, SHA-256, SHA-1.
    *     GTK PuTTY now supports non-X11 displays (e.g. Wayland) and high-DPI configurations.
    *     Type-ahead now works as soon as a PuTTY window is opened: keystrokes typed before authentication has finished will be buffered instead of being dropped.
    *     Support for GSSAPI key exchange: an alternative to the older GSSAPI authentication system which can keep your forwarded Kerberos credentials updated during a long session.
    *     More choices of user interface for clipboard handling.
    *     New terminal features: support the REP escape sequence (fixing an ncurses screen redraw failure), true colour, and SGR 2 dim text.
    *     Pressing Ctrl+Shift+PgUp or Ctrl+Shift+PgDn now takes you straight to the top or bottom of the terminal scrollback.

The course covers Python fundamentals, but from a Network Engineer's perspective. This generally implies the exercises, and examples are much more oriented towards networking.

The course is delivered via email and consists of videos, exercises, and additional content. The course uses Python3.6 and the weekly syllabus is as follows:

* Week1 - Why Python, the Python Interpreter Shell, and Strings
* Week2 - Numbers, Files, Lists, and Linters
* Week3 - Conditionals and Loops
* Week4 - Dictionaries, Exceptions, and Regular Expressions
* Week5 - Functions and the Python Debugger
* Week6 - Netmiko Basics
* Week7 - Jinja2 Basics, Introduction to YAML and JSON, Complex Data Structures
* Week8 - Libraries, Package Installation, and Virtual Environments

t8nulq,networking,1646655001.0,"Summary: Spectrum ""upgraded"" our DOCSIS cable modem and it broke all of our IP phones. I discovered they are rate-limiting inbound port 5060 traffic. Spectrum ""support"" is worthless and unwilling to help. You might be affected too. I'll show you how to test, and how to exploit this vulnerability.

This is a really long nightmare of a story, so stay with me.

I am a network engineer with a client who uses IP phones at all of their business locations. Last November, nearly four months ago, Spectrum came out and replaced our old DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem with a DOCSIS 3.1 modem and router pair after we upgraded the service speed. They installed a Hitron EN2251 cable modem and Sagemcom RAC2V1S router. Immediately afterwards I started getting complaints that phones were not working.

I've isolated it down to the cable modem and/or the service coming from the CMTS/Head Node.

To be technical: Spectrum is rate-limiting all inbound ip4 packets with a source OR destination port of 5060, both UDP and TCP. The rate limit is approximately **15Kbps** and is global to all inbound port-5060 packets transiting the cable modem, not session or IP-scoped in any way. Outbound traffic appears to be unaffected. By ""inbound"" I mean from the internet to CPE.

I won't bore you with the tremendous amount of effort and time that was put into troubleshooting and isolating this problem, but I want to make it clear right away that this isn't a problem with our firewall. This isn't a problem with the Sagemcom RAC2V1S router either. This is not a SIP-ALG problem.

For those of you who are security conscious and paying attention, yes, this is an exploitable vulnerability. Anyone can send a tiny amount of spoofed traffic to any IP behind one of these cable modems and it will knock out all VOIP services using standard SIP on 5060.

----------

**Demonstrating the problem.**

Below I run four iperf3 tests. First I run two baseline tests coming from port 5061 to show what things should look like. Then I the same tests but change the client source port to 5060. I've provide both the client and server stdout. The TCP traffic gets limited down to 14Kbps, and UDP sees 98% packet loss. IP addresses have been changed for privacy.



**Test #1. TCP baseline test, traffic unaffected.**

**How can you find out if you are affected?**

It's notable that not all Spectrum service seem to be affected. My customer has two other locations in the same city, not even five miles away, with Spectrum service, and both of those are unaffected by this problem. However, those locations have older DOCSIS 3.0 modems (Arris TG862G) on older legacy speed plans. Remember that we didn't have this problem before Spectrum came out and replaced equipment.

Suspected affected cable modem models include E31N2V1, E31T2V1, E31U2V1, EN2251, ET2251, EU2251, and ES2251. These are given out for Spectrum's Ultra plans and anything over 300Mbps.

I've verified that at least one other Spectrum customer is affected, but I don't know how widespread this is.

To test, you will need to use the iperf3 tool to do a rate limit test.

iperf is available for Windows, linux, Mac, Android, and more: https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php

You will need both a client and server system.

NOTE: If you don't have access to good client system with a public IP address on the internet, set up your server, leave it up, and send me a PM with your IP address and port. I can run a test against it and send you the results. If you are paranoid about security, just use some port like 61235.

The server should reside behind the cable modem being tested. The default port is 5201, but you can use any port on the server side as long as it's not 5060. It's okay to port-forward the server to a NAT firewall.

The client needs to be out on the internet somewhere and it needs to have a real unique public IP address. It probably can't be behind a NAT firewall because we need to control the source port it uses to send traffic to the server. Pay attention to the client traffic coming into the server side. If the port gets translated to something other than we specify with ""--cport"" the test won't be valid.

The server is really easy to set up. Just do ""iperf3 -s"" to start the server and leave it running. Add ""-p 61235"" to specify a different port.

The client is where the action is. We want to send traffic to the server and make sure it's received.

Run the following four commands on the client system:

iperf3 -c $IPERF_SERVER -p 5201 --cport 5061 -t 10 -b 5M

iperf3 -c $IPERF_SERVER -p 5201 --cport 5061 -t 10 -b 1M -u

iperf3 -c $IPERF_SERVER -p 5201 --cport 5060 -t 10 -b 5M

iperf3 -c $IPERF_SERVER -p 5201 --cport 5060 -t 10 -b 1M -u 

-c is for the client IP. replace the $IPERF_SERVER with your server public IP. -p is the server port and should match the server, the default is 5201. -t is length of test, 10 seconds. -b is bandwidth, limited to 5Mbps for TCP and 1Mbps for UDP. -u is a UDP test, as opposed to the default TCP.

--cport is the client traffic source port, and this is where the magic happens. I'm using port 5061 as a baseline measurement port, which should be unaffected by any rate limit, but you could use anything other than 5060.

It's normal to see some small (<5%) packet loss on the UDP tests. Also, don't worry if you can't get 5Mbps on the TCP test. Just pay attention the difference between using port source port 5060 and anything else.

If Spectrum is rate-liming your traffic, you will notice a substantial difference in the results. You might see 100Mbps on the port 5061 test and then less than 20Kbps on the 5060 test. On UDP you would see nearly 0% packet loss on the UDP baseline test and >80% loss on the 5060 test.

----------

**Q: If this problem was widespread, other people would have noticed, right?**

This is the big question I have right now. Why are we are affected, and who is else out there affected as well? You would think that people would notice if all of their SIP phones stopped working, but it turns out the rate limit is just high enough to let a few phones through without trouble. It's possible this problem is limited to certain accounts, or maybe it's regional, the head node/CMTS, or maybe other customers don't have enough phones to notice.

I've found one other customer who can reproduce the problem, so I know it's not just us.

My testing shows I can get up to 7 of our Yealink phones registered with the SIP server, as long as I stagger their initial connections. With less than 4 phones I can't trigger the issue at all because there isn't enough SIP traffic. Anything past 10 phones causes all of them to constantly lose their registration. The more phones, the more SIP traffic, and the worse the problem gets.

Most customers probably don't have as many phones as we do, and this problem only seems to be affecting the newer cable modems and higher-tier service, and not all VOIP providers use ports 5060 for their signaling traffic. So, yes, It's possible this is a national issue and nobody has noticed or been able to figure out what's going on here.

----------

**Q: So why would Spectrum be doing this? What's their motive?**

I suspect the answer might be right here:  

[DDoS Attacks: VoIP Service Providers Under Pressure](https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-breaches-and-attacks/ddos-attacks-ransomware-target-voip-service-providers/)

[Phone calls disrupted by ongoing DDoS cyber attack on VOIP.ms](
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/canadian-voip-provider-hit-by-ddos-attack-phone-calls-disrupted/)

I think this might be some kind of idiot's Denial of Service policy gone wrong.

[Spectrum has a product specification sheet here that mentiones ""Security • DOS (denial of service) attack protection"".](https://d15yx0mnc9teae.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/SpectrumD31EMTA_New_Sheet.pdf)

Back in late September of 2021, just about 30 days before this problem started, a number of VOIP server/carriers were hit with large DDoS attacks. My client's phones were affected by this attack too, and we noticed, but it only lasted a couple of days and then the attack was mitigated.

It's possible Spectrum was trying to prevent or mitigate reflection attacks against their customers, [or maybe they are being anti-competitive and trying to force customers into using their own VOIP services](https://enterprise.spectrum.com/l/articles/business-voip.html). Who knows and I don't care.

It's noteworthy that the modem also restricts the amount of ICMP traffic it generates (non transit) so heavily that two MTR sessions will cause it to start dropping packets. If they are dumb enough to do that, then I can see them fucking with other types of traffic as well.

All other traffic seems to be unaffected, as far as I know, but I wouldn't be shocked to find out something else is limited. I did test a couple of ports common to reflection attacks such as 53 and 123 but they turned up negative.

----------

**Testing methods and other information.**

This isn't a problem with any IP allocation, though I didn't test ipv6. We get a /29 from Spectrum, but if you plug directly into the cable modem you can get a public-unique IP address from a completely different subnet via DHCP, but the problem persists. Changing your CPE MAC address causes a new IP address to be allocated, so it's easy to test different addresses. This also makes it clear the problem isn't the Sagemcom RAC2V1S router that Spectrum mandates we use for the IP allocation.

I'm fairly certain this isn't a SIP-ALG service in the cable modem, but that's possible. The content of the packets doesn't matter, and I can't find any evidence that SIP traffic is actually being transformed in any way, even after trying. Both MonsterVOIP and RingLOGIX have SIP-ALG test tools and those pass because they don't send enough traffic to trigger the rate limit.

We've eliminated all other possibilities at this point. We tested four different firewalls and linux boxes behind the modem. The fact that we have other Spectrum locations in the same city to test from, just miles away, means we ruled out a 3rd party transit provider too. There's literally nothing left but Spectrum to blame here.

----------

**What about Intel Puma chipsets?**

While researching this problem I learned all about the issues with Intel Puma chipsets in DOCSIS cable modems. I really don't know if this is the source of problem or if this is some kind of policy administratively imposed.

Apparently there are only two DOCSIS 3.1 chipsets currently on the market, [the Intel Puma 7 (Intel FHCE2712M) and the Broadcom BCM3390](https://deviwiki.com/wiki/List_of_DOCSIS_Cable_Modems#DOCSIS_3.1_cable_modems).

The older Intel Puma 6 chips [are extremely well-known for being terrible](https://lookgadgets.com/articles/intel-puma-modems-list/). There are [countless articles documenting all of the modems](https://approvedmodems.org/bad-modems/) they are in, and which to avoid. There's been class action lawsuits. [To say they are not good is an understatement](https://www.yourbestdigs.com/reviews/the-best-modem-for-spectrum/). Apparently the newer Puma 7 chips still have latency problems.

We've had a Hitron EN2251 and a Sercomm ES2251 installed and both of those modems definitely have an Intel Puma 7 chipset. But we recently got a Technicolor ET2251 installed, and that's supposed to maybe have a Broadcom chip. Unfortunately the port 5060 limiting continues.

There are some rumors that the Technicolor and Ubee variants of these modems may have the Broadcom chip, but other rumors say the newer units after 2018 have Intel Puma chips too, and I just don't know what the truth is. Unfortunately this client is far far away so I can't just take a screwdriver and crack the case to find out.

Note that my client has a business account and Spectrum will absolutely not let us use our own cable modem. [They mandate that they supply the modem](https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/compliant-modems-spectrum-network), and because we have static IPs, they give us that dumb Sagemcom router too. I've made attempts to procure our own supplied modem but nobody at Spectrum will allow it. Both Spectrum's dispatch techs and support reps say that you can't request specific hardware when requesting a modem swap and that you get whatever the warehouse sends and you'll like it.

----------

**What to do?**

There is absolutely zero justification for Spectrum to be fucking with our SIP traffic like this, or any other traffic.

To work around this issue I simply routed the SIP traffic out over a VPN tunnel to one of our other nearby locations, which also has Spectrum service, and that makes the problem go away. But, in the long term I don't want to do stupid workarounds like this.

If our VOIP provider supported service using a port other than 5060 we could change the phones to use that, but they don't. We plan to ditch our current provider in the next year anyway, so that'll probably take care of the problem too.

Beyond the above, we already have some lawyer letters going out to the FCC and state government. If I can't get anyone at Spectrum with two brain cells to rub together here soon, we will file a claim in small claims court, which is something I've done a couple of times before, and it's very effective. When the corporate office lawyers get involved and they have to send an employee to court, shit gets fixed real fast.

But I'm definitely open to suggestions.

Ubiquiti  has included a phone home ""feature"" in all their devices in their new  firmware. This ""feature"" transmits all of the device metrics, this may include  sensitive data like type and time of all connected devices, first 8  digits of the MAC addresses, transferred data amount and speed.

And no this is not optional or connected to the automatic firmware update feature. **ALL**  devices with the current firmware do this! Eaven if you block the  access points but still have a USG - it collects the data from them  circumventing the firewall.

* But the way this is handled by the company is even more horrendous:
* They didn't post a note in the changelog sneaking this ""feature"" in
* They made it mandatory ( no option to turn it off)

Also  I have to inform some people here that their new policy is not  compatible with European data protection law and thus their network  needs to be significantly - imagine their joy in that...

It is suggested that you can use a DNS server to block [trace.svc.ui.com](https://trace.svc.ui.com) and [ping.ui.com](https://ping.ui.com) to avoid this data collection.

I work for a major telecom provider, we have millions of clients (consumers and businesses).

Last week, an engineer in the maintenance/operations team was migrating some public /30 subnets (enterprise clients) configured in our global public internet vrf.
He was migrating them from the PE router to a smaller aggregation router.

However, for one client (/30), when he configured the interface on the new router, he put /3 instead of /30.

As a result, thousands of public addresses on our network were duplicated, and ended up blackholed, including our DNS servers.

So there was a nationwide outage for a few hours, before anyone could figure out what was going on.

The guy is still keeping his job by the way.

o83qgq,networking,1624681568.0,"This might be a bit long. I'm mainly posting it in case some other poor soul runs across a similar situation, and because this is the first problem in my networking career that I almost had to walk away from. 

I'm a senior somethingorother at an enterprise that's fairly distributed, and highly reliant on ""the cloud"". Due to our size there can often be 10-15 hops before we even reach the internet from our enterprise, which is an important detail that plays in later. I've seen a lot of problems in my time but this specific one had me and quite a few others confused for a while, especially due to a lot of contradictory evidence. 

Users start reporting connectivity issues with a $cloud\_vendor API from one of our datacenters, DC in North America, cloud API being in Europe. Previously this was working fine, and they indicate no changes were made on their side. Just this one region wasn't working, we hit the same API service from the same cloud provider in both north american and APJ regions with no issues from the same machines. 

A packet capture from the client shows that there is likely packet loss here, with TCP retransmissions occurring until the death of the TCP flow via a FIN from the cloud provider's API server. Right away we saw that the TCP three way handshake worked fine, but our TLS client hello was seemingly never making it to the far end, the client was retransmitting it until the FIN came from the cloud provider because of them never receiving any data and just  seeing it as an idle connection. It turns out this was possible to replicate 100% of the time from any CentOS 6/7/8, Ubuntu 18/20, Debian, or FreeBSD server in the datacenter,  VM or bare metal. 

Begin troubleshooting, and we do a packet capture at the datacenter edge where we connect into the wider enterprise network. This packet capture shows the lost TLS client hello leaving our network, with the packet being well-formed and not borked in transit. We engage the enterprise network admins, and in turn they do a packet capture at the enterprise edge on the cross-connect to the transit provider that was handling this flow; TLS client hello is also seen leaving here. At this point, we see the packet leaving the edge of our network and believe that we have exonerated our network and needed help from the cloud provider to determine if they were receiving the packet. 

While waiting for the cloud provider to get in gear (And stop blaming our datacenter network, enterprise network,  firewalls, ""outdated"" Linux kernels (that are as up to date at the still supported distro ships...), ""outdated"" TLS libraries, ""outdated"" curl, missing root CA certificates on our client, our TCP/IP stacks all being configured wrong, the color of paint in the datacenter not being to their liking) we did a bunch more troubleshooting. The default TTL on these Linux distros is 64, and we don't mess with that since we have NEVER had an issue with it. One of the first things we did was a traceroute, and we consistently saw the destination IP at hop 48, which we felt was far enough away from 64 for comfort. Additionally, a packet capture at our enterprise edge, datacenter edge, and host shows we are not getting an ICMP TTL exceeded back. So we moved on. 

MTU/MSS was our next thought, the TLS client hello was only 300\~ bytes but it needed to be ruled out so we pulled at this thread for a while as well, but it went nowhere since we were quickly able to rule this out based on some testing and playing with MTU + MSS clamping. For what its worth, most engineers I talked to about this problem quickly thought of MTU or MSS being the issue, so this wasn't time wasted by any means. 

We determine that MacOS and Windows work fine from the same datacenter VLANs as the broken Linux clients, which confuses us a bit more and we start to rabbit hole on the fact its the TLS client hello getting lost and start to consider weird possibilities like the ciphersuites, extensions, or something else in the packet is tripping up a middle box somehow since of course the packets look very different from each OS. Honestly we did so much more troubleshooting in here like turning off TCP sequence randomization on our firewalls, bypassing TCP state checks on our firewalls, fast pathing traffic through any middle boxes, deploying machines right from vendor ISOs, etc. Nothing worked. 

Since the API server is cloud service provider managed its not like we can get a packet capture on our own, so we were stuck here since the cloud provider kept telling us getting a packet capture wasn't possible. We argued that talking to all three transit providers between us in North America, and the cloud provider in Europe with like 30\~ hops doing packet captures to determine where the packet was being lost would be insane. Again, we knew the lost TLS client hello was leaving our network, but we could not know if it was making it to the cloud provider and this seemed  the best thing to check first. Their network engineers did not agree and fell back to the good old ""Well no one else is having problems, and we're big, so clearly  your network is broken""... Even though we were the only ones to ever provide packet captures. 

Around this time we figure out that $cloud\_provider's own Linux distro which is based on RHEL works fine from our datacenter, in the same VLANs. We ask the cloud provider what they have customized in this distro, and start doing our own A/B comparisons for proc tuneables related  to TCP/IP. Turns out they touched a lot, and this was going to take time. 

We setup our own instances running an httpd in the same region from the same cloud provider, and could not replicate the problem with clients from the same datacenter VLANs. It was only to the cloud provider's API. 

I walk away from this having been working on it from weeks and decide I need to take a fresh approach. We knew that HTTPS wasn't working (using multiple clients like curl, openssl s\_client, etc) due to the TLS client hello getting lost, but what about just telnetting to the API and sending data, would that data get ACKd at least even if that application/httpd didn't understand it? This turned out to be key. Even the tiny telnet packets with junk data weren't getting ACKd,  and we saw the same retransmissions until the death of the flow via FIN from the cloud provider. In fact, NO data packets from this made it to the far end, the very first data packet never gets ACKd. At this point this eliminated a whole whack of possibilities, and I knew it was time to focus on the lower layers. I went to the working $cloud\_provider distro VM and checked the default TTL, 255. Set the default TTL on our other Linux VMs to 255, and of course things start working. 

There was a lot of conflicting data here between the traceroute showing this being 48 hops away, the TCP handshake working, the data packets not, the FIN,ACK packets from our side working to acknowledge the teardown of the flow, mixed in with a bunch of other things. As best we can tell (because $cloud\_provider won't tell us any of the secret sauce) the cloud provider offloads some of the mundane TCP stuff, but the data packets to this service go further to some backend, either over load balancers or some ECMP/other load balancing setup that decrement the TTL but DO NOT originate an ICMP TTL exceeded message helpfully. We brought this up to them and it was more or less shrugged off, had we gotten this ICMP message we wouldn't have wasted to much time on this. We also indicated that this totally could be hit by any customer sufficient hops away, and their claim of ""its just you"" was not very convincing.  I really doubt any transit providers are filtering these ICMP TTL  exceeded messages, so its pretty likely the cloud provider isn't originating it because we know for sure it never even hits our enterprise edge. 

A lot of lessons learned here, and I probably even missed some of the more obscure things we tried while trying to debug this.

4azifh,networking,1458324830.0,"So... as background, I work on a small campus of buildings that were all built pre-1960 or so... Lots of steel and concrete. Easy to understand that cellular signal is mostly nonexistent in a majority of the buildings interior.

Starting a little over a year ago, Verizon pushed an initiative to blanket our entire campus with their LTE signal. This involved running TONS of single-mode fiber to, what I can only equate to LE's, amps, and media converters that basically look like 2ft square heatsinks mounted to the walls, with what I believe is some form of coax coming out of them and running to their antennas that are distributed through each floor of the buildings. Some floors have 3 or 4 of these ""nodes"". This included covering our below-ground parking deck and roofline/courtyard as well. Eventually, when all was said and done, they ended up elbowing into one of our larger switch closets and adding 3 full-height racks of equipment.

So, throughout this process, we heard from AT&T subscribers (aka our employees) how horrid the service was, to which I would respond ""Verizon works great anywhere on campus!""  which included informing them of all the work and money VZW had to invest in putting that equipment in place to do so, and I informed them that I have seen AT&T in the buildings doing surveys and conducting meetings and discussions around doing the same thing.

We've already had 2 different contract groups from AT&T come in, before the VZW rollout was complete, to do their own site surveys and find their weak spots and estimate how to increase their coverage and such. Both my boss and I have spent DAYS walking these crews through our closets, around floors, showing them conduits, where the VZW nodes are, etc.

Now, crew #3 is here. They're asking us is we have switch ports available for them to plug into, that we can vlan back to one of their routers that they'll put in one of our closets. LOL NO? I'm not really prepared to become a service provider for AT&T's cellular network.

Well then, do we have any dark fiber pairs that they can use and run their own infrastructure? LOL NO, those pairs are there for my capacity expansion and redundancy in the event a pair goes bad, which we've had happen on more than one occasion.

Ok so, that's fine, but before we can do our walkthrough and test for radio coverage, can you unplug all the Verizon nodes so it doesn't interfere with our survey? LOL WTF NO... That's not even my equipment. It's not my network. It doesn't even belong to my company. No way in hell I'm just going to just pull power on probably 30+ nodes for a major telecom provider in the middle of a metropolitan area, which just happens to be feeding all of our customers during the busiest hours (i.e. the weekend between 10 AM and 2 PM).

So now they've involved IT, Engineering, Facilities, Security, and we will probably need to get some C-level exec with a contact that did the original VZW rollout to get a VZW tech out here to properly shut these nodes down (if they even can) and do all of this during off-hours, which for us is Midnight - 6 AM.

Oh, and they want this done next week.

These people can't seriously think this is OK, can they?

Hi All,

I handle mergers and acquisitions, and during that process we are responsible for transferring terabytes of data from one old company to the new company.

I wrote this ""how to / guide"" for the guys doing the remote office file copy to the data center.

Though this is for huge data, the limitations are the same for everyone who now can get large network WAN pipes for cheap money but don't understand why their file copies / data transfers are running slow. **This post is design for Network IT staff to point business users to this post for understanding as to why file copies are slow over giant WAN network circuits in ""GENERAL"".**

\*\* This post also contains solutions to beat the limitations - **Do not do this stuff when on a shared network with lots of users who ALL depend network performance.**  It could easily saturate the network and drop users from WAN file shares, applications, etc ..

Anyway, here is some of my recommendations / you will need to test which solution(s) work best – I am sure many of these you’re using already. Hopefully a few of these are new and can help:

**First a reference point:** Network speed is in mbps (mega bits) and file size is in MB (mega bytes) Not that it is possible, but in theory to send 100 MB file almost instantly you would need a 800 mpbs /1gig network (8 bits to a byte).

**If I had a 1gig network, Why can't I actually send files instantly?**

1. **File checking** – Small files create a significant problem because Windows will check that the file does not exist first and then copy. This check on small files could take longer than actually coping the file.
2. **Network overhead** – 100 MB of files is usually around 110MB of data once wrapped in network headers, etc
3. **Network latency** – the further you are away from the destination the longer the systems WAIT for acknowledgements between each packet group sent.

a. **Why are the systems waiting?** Send 10 data packets – WAIT for a reply that the other side received the data then send 10 more – repeat – when you send Billions of packets, **the WAITING is the killer in WAN transfers**

b. Example - When systems are sending data but in WAIT state - no data is sent so it appears that the network utilization / transfer speeds are really low.

c. Not actual but examples to demonstrate my point

i. Houston Tx to Dallas Tx perceived network utilization average of 80mb of 100mb line (5ms latency)

ii. California to Dallas may look like file copy speed of 15mb of 100mb line (50ms latency)

iii. If I upgrade the WAN network from 100mb to 10gig monster circuit, California to Dallas is still 15mb copy speed because you did NOT change the network latency. The wait time is the killer.

iv. You can not improve network latency as networks are mostly built on fiber optics. (your limited by the speed of light in long haul circuits)

Solutions:

4. **Multi-treaded RoboCopy** using xxx threads where x=Site Network bandwidth / 5. – with high latency and fat network pipes – each thread should be able to grab a perceived 5mbps

a. Treads are like opening up a different window and running copy x times from different windows.

b. The improvement comes from using the WAIT window to burst a different set of data.

c. Example on how to calculate thread count – 150mbps WAN connection = 150mb/5mb = 30 threads

d. Change thread count based on actual tests from the site (max 128)

i. Run a test with 100mb files with x threads

ii. Run a test with 100mb files with Y threads

iii. Adjust as needed – Crazy high thread count may be worse as multiple reads hit different areas of a local hard drive and will create it’s own internal wait time issue.

e. [https://pureinfotech.com/robocopy-multithreaded-file-copy-windows-10/](https://pureinfotech.com/robocopy-multithreaded-file-copy-windows-10/)

5. Most **USB drives can’t push 100mb**, not even close. Copy the files to the local disk if you can before copying to the DC.

6. **Encrypted local drives also reduce performance**

a. **Faster CPU improves decryption** / grab a new machine not an old one to do the file copy.

b. Test in the office laptop to laptop to determine laptop limitations

i. Use this to gauge how many laptops you need. (see below)

7. **Disk reads from a single disk are limited** by drive spinning speed. SSD drive preferred but still have limits. Remember it is not burst speed it is sustained read speed that is important to copy files, which is a slower rating and not usually advertised.

8. **Desktops are FASTER across the board**

a. Laptops are designed to be energy (battery) efficient.

b. Desktops use hardware, which is fast / not energy efficient.

c. RoboCopy is a program – uses CPU, etc .. you don’t want energy efficient

d. Network card drivers are a program – it uses CPU

e. Usually you get twice as many CPU cores on a desktop which helps off load other apps running at the same time as the copy

f. Disable any power saving features

9. You should be able to obtain the same performance improvement or even better than 

aggressive multi-threading if, you **take the data set and spread it across multiple desktops or laptops with multi-threading robo-copy**.

a. User home drives A to P on one laptop

b. Users Home drives P to Z on another

c. Department shares on another

d. etc.

10. The best solution would be server to server where file data is striped across multiple drives and using high speed disk controllers and killer CPUs / OS designed for file transfers using multi-threaded robocopy.

11. There are registry hacks that allow for WAIT window tweaking but my preference is for multi-threads / multi-copies as in theory the windows operating system will adjust the WAIT window on it’s own based on response times.

12. **Don’t forget there is also a limitation to how fast data can be written** to the Data Center storage solution. It isn’t just you writing data, thousands of people use it all the time during the day and backup job contention at night. If your using laptop to laptop over a WAN, remember Disk reads are usually twice as fast as disk writes. The writing could become the weakest link.

a. **Don’t grab 50 laptops from an integration and saturate a 1gig WAN connection** which in turn sends 1gig of data to one Storage Solution .. that will impact everyone using the file share or the backup process.

b. The receiving storage solution also has a preferred received thread count – more laptops and threads isn’t always better. Again – test with 100mb of data and determine what works best.

**There is a sweet spot in the middle somewhere, just need to find it.**

So, reading Cisco docs is not really clear. Is there anyone that knows how the order works based on configurations for AAA, local passwords and line configs? 

Which config part overwrites which part?  
If you want a local login as a backup, is that the ""local"" keyword at the end of AAA lines?  
Not gonna lie, I don't really know what ""exec"", ""system"", ""default"",""start-stop"" actually means here.
Are the ""username"", and ""AAA"" config lines the foundation, and then you apply them to the console or line vty lines? Do the line vty line configs dictate the login mechanism? 



For example:

	username admin privilege 15 secret 5 <encrypted password>
	
    aaa session-id common
	aaa new-model
	
	aaa group server tacacs+ TACACS_SERVER
      server-private 1.1.1.1 key 7 <key1>
      server-private 1.1.1.2 key 7 <key2>
      ip tacacs source-interface Loopback0
 
    aaa authentication login SSH group TACACS_SERVER local
    aaa authentication login CONSOLE none
    aaa authorization exec SSH group TACACS_SERVER local
    aaa accounting system default start-stop group tacacs+

	ip ssh maxstartups 3
    ip ssh authentication-retries 5
    ip ssh version 2
    ip ssh pubkey-chain
      username <automation_station)
       key-hash ssh-rsa <hash> <user@station-id>
   
   
    line con 0
      logging synchronous
      login authentication CONSOLE
      stopbits 1
    line aux 0
      stopbits 1
    line vty 0 4
      access-class net-mgmt-access in vrf-also
      exec-timeout 30 0
      authorization exec SSH
      logging synchronous
      login authentication SSH
      transport input ssh
    line vty 5 15
      access-class net-mgmt-access in vrf-also
      exec-timeout 30 0
      transport input ssh

j2p0wz,networking,1601482051.0,"Wi-Fi as we know it today is a series of standards, voted on by a worldwide engineering body, the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers). The IEEE is an open membership organization with more than 423,000 engineers in 160 countries. It took years of work and dozens of proposals to form the original Wi-Fi standard in 1997. It took even more effort over the last 23 years to get to where we are now. 

The story of the invention of Wi-Fi depends on who you ask. There is a complicated history leading up to that original 1997 standard, and the truth is hard to decipher. I'm not capable of litigating who invented what, but there are some key players to know about. Where possible, I will point out the people and the organizations behind the technology. 

## Wired and Wireless Precursors: Say ALOHA to Wireless Networking

In 1968, researchers at the University of Hawaii began to investigate if radio waves could be used for communication between computers. The project was led by professor [Norman Abramson](http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/faculty/detail.php?usr=34), [Dr. Franklin Kuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_F._Kuo), and a team of faculty and students. It would go on to become known as [ALOHAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet). 

During this time, wired computer networking was in its infancy, and evolving rapidly. Packet switching was conceived of by [Paul Baran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran) in 1964, and first demonstrated by [Donald Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies) in August 1968. In October 1969, the first [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) link was established between UCLA and the Stanford. By June 1971, ALOHAnet was the world's first wireless packet switched data network.(1)

During the development of ALOHAnet, Abramson and his team had to solve many foundational issues with wireless networking, including collisions and failed transmissions. They decided that a random access protocol would be the best way to accomplish this. The ALOHA protocol allowed terminals to send data whenever they had it, and listen to their transmissions to make sure they were received, and acknowledged. If a transmission failed, terminals would resend after a random delay. This was simple and effective, but had problems scaling up to more users. The ALOHA protocol was improved and expanded, and was the inspiration for [CSMA/CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance).

ALOHAnet was a pioneering technological marvel, but it was experimental and not fit for commercial use. Most critically, unlicensed spectrum for computer communications was not available to the public yet. Since the University of Hawaii didn't have a way to sell the technology, it was put into the public domain. ALOHAnet was decommissioned in 1976, but it inspired others to continue what it started. Most notably, [Robert ""Bob"" Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe) studied it for his PhD dissertation. 

Through the 1970s, many wired local area network technologies were developed. Some were proprietary, and some were open standards. Most of this early work has gone on to become [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute) or IEEE standards, and formed the basis of the computer communication and the Internet. A standards-based approach wasn't destiny, and we all benefit from the pioneers who pushed for standards over proprietary solutions. All of this groundbreaking work on wired standards helped lay the foundation for wireless. 

### Key Dates In Wired Networking History

- 1973: Bob Metcalf and [David Boggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boggs) created the basis for Ethernet while working at the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California. They were inspired by the packet-based approach of ARPAnet and ALOHAnet, and refined that design. On November 11, 1973, the first Ethernet system was functional.
- 1974: Cambridge Ring was developed at the University of Cambridge, forming the basis of what became Token Ring. Through the 1970s Werner Bux, Hans Müller, and other IBM employees worked on the design of what became IBM's proprietary [Token Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring).
- 1974: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn publish ""[A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf)"" which describes TCP and lays the groundwork for TCP/IP. 
- 1975: Xerox files for a patent for Ethernet.
- 1978: Jonathan B. Postel writes the [first specification of IPv4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien41.pdf).
- 1979: Xerox opts to make Ethernet an open standard to help with manufacturing, and to spur sales of it's products. DEC and Intel join the effort.
- 1980: The IEEE 802.3 committee is formed to make Ethernet an open standard, led by Xerox, DEC, Intel, and other major manufacturers.
- 1980: Engineer [Michael Marcus](http://marcus-spectrum.com/qualifications.html) makes a proposal to the U.S. FCC to open the ISM bands for unlicensed use of spread spectrum modulation and multiple access, going against conventional wisdom at the time. The ISM bands are assumed to have no practical application in communications.
- 1983: The first [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) Ethernet standard, [10BASE5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5), was ratified. Wi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family, and is designed to interwork seamlessly with Ethernet, its wired sibling.
- 1985: IBM introduced their proprietary version of Token Ring, offering 4 Mbps. Due to the integration with IBM computers, Token Ring was popular for a time in the 1980's, until Ethernet grew into the ubiquitous standard it is today.
- 1985: the U.S. Federal Communications Commission opened the [ISM (Industrial, Science, and Medicine) radio bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band) of the wireless spectrum for use in communications without a government license. The released frequencies include: 900 MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz. Other countries and regions eventually followed the FCC's lead. With this spectrum available for anyone to use, the real development of the first commercial wireless network technologies could begin.

## The Wright Brothers of Wi-Fi 

By 1985, all the pieces were in place for the development of a universal wireless networking standard. These were the Wild West days of wireless networking. Dozens of companies were competing to be the first to produce a successful product. Many companies came and went, so I'm only going to focus on the biggest and most important ones. 

### NCR and WaveLAN 

In the 1980s, [NCR Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Corporation) was a big international company selling computers, ATMs, and cash registers. They wanted to develop a way to have their cash registers work wirelessly. This would give them a competitive advantage, and allow retail stores to avoid the costs and logistics of running cabling to every register. At the same time, cash registers were becoming more computer-like, so NCR sought to develop an International wireless standard that any computer could use. Two of the key engineers assigned to this project were [Cees Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cees_Links) and [Vic Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Hayes). Through 1986 and 1987, Vic and the other engineers at NCR developed a product which became known as [WaveLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveLAN). 

NCR introduced WaveLAN to the world in 1990.(2) While WaveLAN was intended for use in cash registers, it was also positioned as a wireless alternative to Ethernet and Token Ring for PCs. In the 1990s, wireless products were expensive, and hard to use. The early drivers were buggy, and documentation was hard to find. WaveLAN network adapters cost hundreds of dollars, and access points could cost thousands. The high cost and limited usability kept WaveLAN as a niche product, mainly found in the big businesses that could afford them.

WaveLAN operated at 900MHz or 2.4 GHz, and offered speeds of 1 to 2 Mbps. It competed with [Aironet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aironet_Wireless_Communications)'s ARLAN and others which offered similar speeds, frequency ranges and hardware. Several companies also marketed wireless bridges and routers based on WaveLAN technology. Wireless networking products became a mess of competing companies and different implementations. The need for an International standard was clear.

NCR wanted to have Vic Hayes make the technical proposals to the IEEE on the companies behalf. Vic disagreed, and fought to stay independent and not do any of the proposals on behalf of NCR. The company agreed, and this actually worked to their benefit. Since Vic wasn't pushing NCR's proprietary solution, he gained the trust of others. Vic ended up becoming the first chairman of the IEEE 802.11 working group, giving him the nickname “Father of Wi-Fi""

### IEEE and the 802.11 working group

In 1988, Vic Hayes approached the IEEE to contribute to the 802.4L, an existing committee creating a wireless standard based on Token Ring. As it turned out, that committee had become inactive, and the chairman had quit. This let to Vic becoming the chairman of 802.4L, and the forming of a new working group, 802.11. Ethernet and WaveLAN technology formed part of the technical base of the 802.11 committee, which was officially started in 1990. 

WaveLAN and the knowledge of Vic Hayes' group at NCR helped form the basis, but countless others contributed as well. Many other companies submitted proposals for various aspects of the standard, and the group compromised and voted on the best ideas along the way. Most of their documents are [still publicly available](https://www.ieee802.org/11/Documents/DocumentArchives/). The 802.11 group continued to work throughout the 1990s to develop the standard, which was a long and complicated process. It took 7 years and input from countless engineers to form the first Wi-Fi standard, known as 802.11-1997. 

The first Wi-Fi standard was in some ways a messy compromise. It allowed for transmissions over Infrared or 2.4 GHz radio waves. It also allowed for two different frequency selection methods, which prevented guaranteed compatibility. In the end, both Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum ([FHSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum)) and Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum ([DSSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum)) were added to the standard. The group allowed these options as a way to please the entities involved in the creation, but it made the standard weak. 

802.11-1997 never gained much traction. Despite that, the group got to work on its next set of standards, 802.11a and 802.11b, which were developed in parallel. The main difference between them was the frequencies and the modulation schemes they used. 

- 802.11a operates in 5 GHz, using [OFDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing) for data rates up to 54 Mbps. 
- 802.11b operates in 2.4 GHz, using [DSSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum) for data rates up to 11 Mbps. 

802.11b hit the market first. Despite the slower speeds, people preferred the availability, lower cost, and longer range of the 2.4 GHz equipment. The success of 802.11b snowballed into the development of 802.11g, and made 2.4 GHz the defacto International wireless spectrum range for years to come.

In the late 1990s, Wi-Fi's success wasn't guaranteed. Early Wi-Fi devices were expensive, slow, and often incompatible with other devices. [According to Vic Hayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl4dtLfnCBM), he approached many computers makers to persuade them to add Wi-Fi to their computers, but most of them said no. Steve Jobs and Apple wanted to add Wi-Fi to an upcoming laptop, but they wanted it to cost $100, not $500. They argued that the lower cost would make it more marketable to consumers. 

Apple eventually got the $100 Wi-Fi card they wanted. The iBook and AirPort [launched on July 21, 1999](https://youtu.be/UgoUMj_3k5c?t=3236), a few months before the 802.11a and 802.11b standard were finalized. It was the first mainstream computer designed and sold with integrated wireless networking. 

### OFDM, CSIRO, and Dr. John O'Sullivan

This is where our story get murky. CSIRO is the Australian federal agency with a long history of scientific research. They have developed many advanced technologies, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy. According to CSIRO, Wi-Fi is an Australian invention. The truth isn't that simple, and it isn't that clear. 

CSIRO's key insight came out of their work in radioastronomy. In 1977, CSIRO researcher Dr. John O'sullivan was searching for small exploding black holes. He wrote a paper about how fast Fourier transformations could be used to sharpen images from optical telescopes. As the waves traveled towards the telescope they became scrambled, and CSIRO developed a custom processor to use fast Fourier transformations to unscramble the image. While this technique didn't help him discover the black holes he was looking for, it helped to solve a different problem.

Starting in 1990, John O'Sullivan led a team of CSIRO scientists to develop a high-speed wireless network. Their goal was 100 Mbps, to compete with the best wired networks of the time. This caused them to look past the techniques used by ALOHAnet and WaveLAN, because they wouldn't be fast enough. One technical challenge they faced was how radio waves tend to bounce off surfaces indoors, causing an echo that distorts the signal. Using fast Fourier transformations, they found a way to transmit a signal while reducing that echo. Rather than using one fast wireless channel, they used lots of slower channels. This is known as [multicarrier modulation](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/radio/multicarrier-modulation/basics-techniques.php).

Single-carrier modulation systems exploit only one signal frequency to transmit data. Multi-carrier modulation systems divide the whole frequency channel into subcarriers, and the data stream is divided into many low-rate streams transmitted in parallel. Single-carrier modulation has advantages, but multi-carrier modulation is better suited for high-bandwidth, short-range communication like Wi-Fi. In modern Wi-Fi standards, we use multi-carrier modulation in the form of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, or OFDM. 

According to their lawyer in a 2009 patent dispute, CSIRO did not invent Wi-Fi, but it did invent the best way of doing it. CSIRO scientists tested hundreds of techniques until it found a unique combination that worked at high speeds. That combination involved multi-carrier modulation, forward error-correcting, and frequency interleaving to send multiple copies of the data. This specific combination of techniques is the secret sauce the CSIRO applied for a patent for in 1992, and was granted in 1996. 

CSIRO didn't invent the underlying techniques, since they were already known. Frequency division multiplexing dates back to the late 1870s, when telegraph companies were trying to increase their capacity. Multi-carrier modulation was described in the 1950s. OFDM is attributed to Bell Labs employee [Robert W. Chang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6769442/) back in 1966. Interleaving also dates back to the 1960s. Forward error correction was used when NASA sent the Mariner mission to Mars in 1968. 

CSIRO also wasn't the first to combine these techniques and apply them to computer communication. Harris Semiconductor sold modems to the US military using these techniques in the 1980s. Critically, the Harris modem was never patented since interleaving, modulation, and coding had been around for decades by the time Harris came along. According to testimony, Intel official Stephen Saltzman said that outside CSIRO, engineers didn't take the idea of a Wi-Fi patent using these techniques seriously. Experts at Intel had already shipped products based on OFDM with previous employers, and thought that a new patent with OFDM didn't seem credible. Regardless of the merits and the origin of the ideas, [US patent #5,487,069](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5487069A/en) was granted in 1996. 

During the development of the 802.11a standard, CSIRO made the IEEE aware of its patent and [offered to license it](https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/governance/patcom/loas/loa-802_11a-csiro-04Dec1998.pdf). Beyond that offer, CSIRO never got involved in the creation of the 802.11 standards. Dozens of companies made proposals to the various 802.11 committees, offering to submit their ideas or license their patents. CSIRO never submitted a proposal for the original 1997 standard, or any of the revisions. Despite their lack of involvement in the process and lack of licensing agreement, 802.11a, 802.11g, and later IEEE standards would go on to use OFDM and multi-carrier modulation.

Years later, CSIRO used this as the basis for lawsuits against major networking and technology companies. CSIRO won settlements worth $205 million in 2009, and another $229 million in 2012. If you want more detail on the CSIRO patent fight, Joe Mullin wrote a [good piece for ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/how-the-aussie-government-invented-wifi-and-sued-its-way-to-430-million/ ""How the Aussie government “invented WiFi” and sued its way to $430 million"") back in 2012. Mark Summerfield [wrote a counter-point to Joe's article for Patentology](https://blog.patentology.com.au/2012/04/analysis-of-csiro-wlan-patent.html), looking at what the CSIRO patent did and didn't cover. 

The truth is a messy thing. In Wi-Fi's case, success truly did have many fathers.

### Footnotes:

1 - ALOHAnet used 100 KHz channels, operating at 9600 baud on the 407 and 413 MHz UHF frequencies. It originally connected seven computers across four islands, which communicated wirelessly with a central computer in a star network topology. 

2 - AT&T would go on to buy NCR in 1991, only to spin off the remnants of the division as NCR and [Lucent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent) by 1996.

We've got a deployment tomorrow that involves rack mounting 4 cisco nexus 3064x switches. Everything's in a truck driving in from across the country for the deployment tomorrow. The on site guys just now informed me that these switches don't have rack mount rails with it. (Due to the rack layout, I can't really support 4 of these things on-top of a single server weight wise.)

It looks like n2k rails or n5k rails might work too from looking at pictures.

They have the rack-mount ears but not the rails that slide into the back, they are also missing the bracket that the rail slides into.

The syllabus is also available at the above link.

The course covers Python fundamentals from a network engineer's perspective. So it covers Python basics using examples and exercises that would be generally familiar to a network engineer. It is definitely a beginners course and doesn't assume any existing Python knowledge.

Towards the end of the course I segue a bit into applying Python to Network Engineering, but this is definitely a minor part of the course (relative to the Python fundamentals content).

The course format is a lesson a week for eight weeks. The lessons come out every Tuesday morning (U.S. Pacific time). The lessons consist of videos, exercises, and additional content.

A bit about myself: I am long-time network engineer (CCIE emeritus in routing and switching). For last several years, I have been really into network automation particularly with Python and Ansible. I am the creator and maintainer of the Python Netmiko Library and also do a reasonable amount of work on both the NAPALM project and on Nornir.

This means service will be available in at least 35 states, including
Hawaii and Florida.

The funding indicates that Starlink is nearing general availability, but the
exact terms of availability are still unclear. There has been no indication
that current $99 pricing will continue and a big question mark is the cost
of the satellite receiver. The receiver currently goes for $499, but there
are strong questions about this and suggestions that the price is heavily
subsidized. So far there is no word on how the FCC subsidy will be used.

From an enterprise perspective even more interesting is what you will be
allowed to do with Starlink connectivity and whether there will be traffic
quotas or shaping, as hinted to by Starlink engineers.

Starlink bid for Above Baseline broadband which equals ≥ 100/20 Mbps
with a data cap of no less than 2 TB.

Even if the data cap is implemented, a Starlink connection would be a good
tool in the data engineer's fallback circuit toolbox.

the government will give you hundreds of millions of dollars to do
something that you would have done anyway :)

c1oosx,networking,1560784366.0,"# Introduction  
Twice per year there is an event in the middle of Sweden. It’s a large festival where visitors bring their computers and play with each other, this is in our industry called a LAN-party. This will be a write up by two members of the team that builds network and infrastructure for this event and will give in-depth information about the struggles but also how we have solved the issue that have come up when building worlds largest LAN-party.  
  
To start with we want to emphasize how happy we are that we get to work with latest hardware from Juniper when building this network. This post does not have anything to do with performance of the hardware, this is a write up on what we have done and how we have planned the network. We are aware that some of the technology is very early state and that there is a possibility for bugs but that is also what makes it fun for us.  
  
This write-up will reflect on one recurring problem we have come by the last years of running with MX series routers from Juniper. And the reason we do this is that we quite fast noticed that there is very little information about troubles in MC-AE when you search for it and with this we hope to help some other network engineer who ends up having similar problems as we have faced. Before this we used Cisco ASR as our core routers but when the chance of working with Juniper came up we got very happy and it has given the team possibility to use completely new hardware and software. The environment consists of multiple different vendors today.  
  
We also want to make clear, that the way we have built the network is not the only way, and we do not claim that it’s the right way either.

[MX10003, QFX5110 & SRX4200](https://i.imgur.com/1IOSCxC.jpg)  
  
# Setup  
During the past years we’ve had a couple of different routers, but the basic setup is the same.  
  
We have two MX series routers as core, with separate interconnections for the L2 switching and L3 routing. Connected to these routers are the distribution switches for services and participants, and access switches to them.  
  
[Drawing](https://i.imgur.com/LMks9FF.jpg)  
  
The routers terminate our internet connection and run BGP+BFD towards the ISP. These routers are standalone but run MC-AE with ICCP for synchronization, no virtual chassis. We have a couple of VRFs, so we run MP-BGP with MPLS L3-VPN to distribute prefixes between the routers, which handle all layer 3 in the network.  
  
Connected to these core routers are the distribution switches. Each switch has one connection to each router in a LACP AE. The routers have one virtual switch per distribution switch since some VLAN IDs are reused, and use one VLAN in a QinQ over the interlink for vswitch to vswitch communication.  
  
The picture below try to visualize how all these logical parts connect to each other.  
[Drawing](https://i.imgur.com/rVvCsS5.png)  

# Problem  
The problem we have identified every time is that clients have problems getting IPv4 addresses assigned from DHCP. This issue then varies between networks (VLAN’s) in the network, some of them do not get DHCP at all and some of them get addresses directly when sending DHCP requests.  
  
The problem seems to arise when both of the unicast DHCP OFFERs happens to be load shared to the “wrong” router from the service distribution switch, the packet with destination IP of R1’s gateway is sent to R2 which in turn routes it out via the IRB to the local subnet and switches it via the vswitch interlink to R1, which drops it.  
  
# Solutions

## Active/Backup LACP from DHCP Server  

By setting the AE facing the DHCP server in LACP active/backup mode, we force both replies towards one of the routers, one will always fail and one will always succeed. The drawback of this is that half of the link capacity is lost.  

## Announce local /32  
  
By default, each address configured on the routers has a /32 entry in the local routing table from the protocol Local, with the BGP community NoReadvrt to avoid sending it to any peers. By setting “set routing-instances VPN_DH routing-options interface-routes family inet export lan” we remove this community and the /32 prefixes are distributed to the other router. So when a DHCP reply arrives at the “wrong” router and it performs its routing lookup, it will use this prefix instead of the /25 Direct one and route it over MPLS, instead of routing it to the local subnet and sending it over the switching link.  
  
Here’s a part of the routing table after the fix:  

    77.80.129.128/25   *[Direct/0] 3d 01:27:59  
                    	>  via irb.104

People using Facebook services typically see better performance over IPv6, but the radio inside many devices requires about 50 ms to warm up. By increasing the timeout from 50 ms to 150 ms, we were able to make sure those devices didn't fall back to IPv4 unnecessarily, and we could keep more people on IPv6 and provide a better experience.

Share some of the networking myths you know, and let's create a list to help dispel some of these myths.

I'll start with eBGP peering between loopbacks. It's common knowledge that you have to change the TTL to 2 when eBGP peering using loopbacks between directly connected routers. That's a myth! A directly connected router is only 1 hop away regardless of the referenced interface. The reason the eBGP peering doesn't come up with TTL 1 is because the router does a check if the neighbor IP is directly connected. Changing the TTL to 2 works because it no longer does the check, not because the loopback is 2 hops away. The appropriate solution is to disable checking for direct connectivity with the following command:

### TL;DR:
- 6 GHz availability is expanding, but far from universal.
- Wi-Fi 6E product selection is limited: Mostly high-end, expensive, and hard to buy.
- Generally speaking, 6 GHz offers less range but higher effective throughput than 5 GHz.
- Wider channels are more feasible than with 5 GHz, and throughput above 1 Gbps is possible. 
- The rules are still being made, and the benefits of 6 GHz haven’t been fully realized yet.

## Wi-Fi 6E Is Here*!
*Kind of. The current status of the 6 GHz spectrum and Wi-Fi 6E is complicated. Getting the details right requires reading through white papers and dense documents from regulatory bodies. It also requires sorting through a lot of marketing hype and outdated or incomplete information.

This post is a summary of everything I’ve been able to find. If you notice anything that is wrong or needs updated, please let me know.

## Quick Review: What Is Wi-Fi 6E?
**Wi-Fi 6E is the Wi-Fi 6 standard, extended into the 6 GHz band**. It uses the same PHY standard as Wi-Fi 6, but offers greater availability of wider channel sizes, and access to clearer spectrum with less interference from legacy Wi-Fi devices. Wi-Fi 6E access points are typically dual or tri-band, and backwards compatible with 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz devices. However, only Wi-Fi 6E clients are able to access the new spectrum. 

The addition of 1200 MHz of spectrum in the 6 GHz band is arguably the biggest change in wireless networking since the original 802.11 standard came out in 1997, or the original allocation of the ISM bands in 1985. For perspective, less than 260 MHz of unrestricted spectrum is available in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. 

Before we look at some Wi-Fi 6E products and performance, I want to look at all the frequencies available for Wi-Fi, where Wi-Fi 6E is available, and the timeline of events that led us here.

## ISM and U-NII Wi-Fi Bands
### 2.4 GHz ISM Band

**2.4 GHz ISM**: 2400 - 2500 MHz
- Availability of the full 100 MHz varies by country.
	* Most allow 82 MHz for Wi-Fi — Channels 1 to 13
	* The US FCC only allows 72 MHz for Wi-Fi — Channels 1 to 11
- Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other wireless technologies also operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

### 5 GHz U-NII Bands
- **U-NII-1**: 5150 - 5250 MHz
- **U-NII-2**: 5250 - 5725 MHz
	- Conflicts with radar and satellite communication, requiring the use of [dynamic frequency selection (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_selection).
	- Broken into three sub-bands, with different rules for each.
		- U-NII-2A — 5250 - 5350 MHz
		- U-NII-2B — 5350 - 5470 MHz (unavailable for Wi-Fi)
		- U-NII-2C — 5470 - 5725 MHz
- **U-NII-3**: 5725 - 5850 MHz
- **U-NII-4**: 5850 - 5925 MHz
	- Generally not available for Wi-Fi. 
	- Since 1999, the US FCC allocated U-NII-4 for a vehicle-safety technology Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), which was never widely used in the US.
	- In late 2020, the  [US FCC reallocated 45 MHz (5850 - 5895 MHz) for use in Wi-Fi](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/fcc-adds-45mhz-to-wi-fi-promising-supersize-networks-on-5ghz-band/). 
		- Indoor operation is allowed, and outdoor operation rules are still being finalized.
		- The other 30 MHz (5895 - 5925 MHz) is set aside for a newer vehicle-safety technology called [Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/qualcomm-covers-all-the-bases-with-a-cellular-vehicle-to-everything-chipset/) (C-V2X).

### 6 GHz U-NII Bands (Wi-Fi 6E)
- **U-NII-5**: 5925 - 6425 MHz
	- Indoor/outdoor
	- Channels 1 to 97
- **U-NII-6**: 6425 - 6525 MHz
	- Indoor only
	- Channels 101 to 117
- **U-NII-7**: 6525 - 6875 MHz
	- Indoor/outdoor
	- Channels 121 to 185
- **U-NII-8**: 6875 - 7125 MHz
	- Indoor only
	- Channels 189 to 223

Refer to the [U-NII Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicensed_National_Information_Infrastructure) and [List of WLAN channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) for more details, and a breakdown of availability by country.

## Wi-Fi 6E Availability (as of May 2021)
While the US FCC was the first to announce a decision, regulators around the world have been considering making 6 GHz unlicensed for years. Some regulators are still working through that process, and some haven’t officially started. As of May 2021, this is the list of countries where unlicensed 6 GHz operation is being made possible. [The Wi-Fi Alliance maintains a list of all countries enabling Wi-Fi 6E](https://www.wi-fi.org/countries-enabling-wi-fi-6e).

### Approved Full 1200 MHz
Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Saudia Arabia, South Korea, United States.

### Approved 500 MHz (U-NII-5 only)
European Union* (5925-5945 MHz excluded), Greenland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom.

### Considering Full 1200 MHz
Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, Qatar.

### Considering 500 MHz (U-NII-5 only)
Argentina, Africa (ATU), Egypt, Oman, Russia, Turkey.

## Wi-Fi 6E Device Classes and EIRP Limits
There are three main categories of Wi-Fi 6E devices. The classes are mostly shared, but the rules controlling their use vary by country. There are more details and exceptions than what I’m listing here. Refer to your local regulatory bodies rules for more details, such as  [the US FCC’s guidance for operating the 6 GHz band](https://apps.fcc.gov/kdb/GetAttachment.html?desc=987594%20D01%20U-NII%206GHz%20General%20Requirements%20v01r02&id=t6B09M024Ig9UWPI0%2BDEuQ%3D%3D&tracking_number=277034). 

### Standard Power (SP)
- Indoors or outdoors, with integrated or external antennas.
- U-NII-5 and U-NII-7 bands only.
- Require the use of an Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) provider to avoiding interfering with incumbent services. 
	- AFC availability is still in process in the US, and other regions are still working on their solutions. AFC is unlikely to be widely available before 2022. 
- SP APs operate at a maximum of 36 dBm EIRP (in the US).
- SP clients are limited to an EIRP 6 dBm less than the AP they’re connected to, typically 30 dBm.
- SP clients rely on their AP for AFC.

### Low Power Indoor (LPI)
- Indoor only, integrated antenna required. 
- LPI APs cannot use external antennas, battery power, or weatherproof enclosures.
- Can use the full 1200 MHz (depending on availability).
- Require contention-based protocols to protect incumbent services, but not AFC.
- LPI APs operate at a maximum of 30 dBm EIRP (in the US).
- LPI clients are limited to an EIRP 6 dBm less than the AP they’re connected to, typically 24 dBm.

### Very Low Power (VLP)
- Mobile, indoors and outdoors, but offer limited range.
- Can use the full 1200 MHz (depending on availability).
- Require contention-based protocols to protect incumbent services, but not AFC.
- Operate at a maximum of 14 dBm EIRP (in the EU).
- The US FCC is still working on their rules for VLP devices.

### Channel Width Impact on EIRP
- Maximum EIRP is calculated for 320 MHz-wide channels, which are not available in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).
	- 802.11be, [the draft of what will likely become Wi-Fi 7](https://www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm), allows for 320 MHz channels.
- 160 MHz channels reduce max EIRP by 3 dBm.
- 80 MHz channels reduce max EIRP by 6 dBm.
- 40 MHz channels reduce max EIRP by 9 dBm.
- 20 MHz channels reduce max EIRP by 12 dBm.
- These numbers are subject to change as 6 GHz rules are finalized, and 802.11be drafts evolve. 

## Wi-Fi 6E Certified Products (as of May 2021)
While the number of countries supporting the 6 GHz band is expanding, the number of 6 GHz devices is too. 338 million Wi-Fi 6 devices are expected to be sold in 2021, and analysts at IDC expect [roughly 20% of all Wi-Fi 6 devices to support the 6E standard by 2022](https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-delivers-wi-fi-6e-certification-program). There are many draft Wi-Fi 6E products available now, but only a handful of them have been officially certified by the Wi-Fi alliance for compatibility and inter-operation.

Refer to the [Wi-Fi Alliance Product Finder](https://www.wi-fi.org/product-finder-results?certifications=1275&sort_by=certified&sort_order=asc) for the most updated list, and details about the specific capabilities that are required to be officially Wi-Fi 6E certified.

## Using Wi-Fi 6E

Like most people, I have spent more time reading about Wi-Fi 6E than using it. Wi-Fi 6E sounds impressive, but how does it work in reality? I don’t have a full answer yet, no one does. It’s still early days for 6 GHz, and we won’t be able to see all of the benefits until more networks and client devices support it. All we can get right now is a sneak peak of what’s to come.

### Intel AX210, Windows Betas, and Wi-Fi Analyzers
I didn’t have a Galaxy S21 Ultra to test with, so that meant I was stuck with an Intel AX210 card. Plug it in, grab the drivers, easy right? Not quite.

Thankfully, trailblazers like Dong Kno and Tim Higgins at Small Net Builder have taken the 6 GHz plunge before I did, and I referred to their findings for help. The first thing I did was follow Tim’s [instructions for getting 6 GHz support enabled on the Intel AX210](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/installing-a-ax210-windows-10-driver-that-works.70226/). Since Microsoft hasn’t officially added support for 6 GHz, I signed up for the Windows 10 Insider program and installed the latest beta. After a few reboots and a minor registry tweak, 6 GHz support was enabled.

Confirming 6 GHz support wasn’t easy, as all the normal (*read: free*) Wi-Fi analyzer apps I tried only recognized the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. I don’t have access to any professional 6 GHz analyzer hardware or software. Until consumer-grade analyzer apps are updated to support Wi-Fi 6E, most of us will be stuck in the same situation.

Adding to the confusion, Windows didn’t show the channels and bands properly, showing all 6 GHz connections as 5 GHz connections on channel 36. By separating the SSIDs I was able to manually connect to the 6 GHz band, and able to confirm a 6 GHz connection in my router's web interface.

### Authentication: WPA3 and OWE
The authentication methods for Wi-Fi 6E clients vary by which band they’re operating in:
- **2.4 GHz**: WPA2, WPA3, WPA2/3 Mixed, OWE, Open
- **5 GHz**: WPA2, WPA3, WPA2/3 Mixed, OWE, Open
- **6 GHz**: WPA3 or OWE

[Wi-Fi Protected Access 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#WPA3)  (WPA3) is the only authentication method available for the 6 GHz band. When I tried to use WPA3 with my Intel AX210 card, I wasn’t able to connect. I’ve read that a future firmware update from Intel will address that. Since I wasn’t able to associate with WPA3-Personal, I turned to my only other option: OWE.

[Opportunistic Wireless Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_Wireless_Encryption) (OWE) is a new standard for encrypting open Wi-Fi networks. It doesn’t provide authentication, meaning anyone can join the network, but it does encrypt the traffic between AP and client. The [Wi-Fi Alliance has a good overview of what OWE is](https://www.wi-fi.org/beacon/dan-harkins/wi-fi-certified-enhanced-open-transparent-wi-fi-protections-without-complexity), and their Wi-Fi Enhanced Open certification. The very short summary of OWE is that it adds encryption without requiring a password. Both WPA3 and OWE rely on AES encryption underneath, but [no security method is perfect](https://www.fragattacks.com/).

### Multi-Gigabit Ports and Early Performance Metrics
What everyone wants to know: yes, you can break the 1 Gbps barrier with 160 MHz and sometimes 80 Mhz channels in 5 GHz or 6 GHz. This requires a strong connection between AP and client, and 2.5 Gbps or higher ports to effectively use. Thankfully, both of the systems I tested had a multi-gigabit port, and 6 GHz allows for multiple 160 MHz channels.

For testing, I got a few 2.5 Gbps and 5 Gbps USB Ethernet adapters, allowing me to break the gigabit barrier and the ~940 Mbps TCP throughput limit of a typical gigabit Ethernet port. 

With 160 MHz channels and a 2.5 Gbps connection, iPerf TCP tests hovered around and above 1 Gbps of throughput to a single client. While this level of performance is possible with 5 GHz, it’s much more realistic to deploy 160 MHz channels or a somewhat-dense 80 MHz channel plan in the 6 GHz band. 

As always, single-client throughput numbers are a shallow way to measure Wi-Fi performance. Interference, contention, and aggregate throughput isn’t something I’m setup to scientifically test, so I’ll point to [Smallnetbuilder’s recent article on that](https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-features/33229-how-much-total-throughput-can-your-wi-fi-router-really-provide).

### The Road Ahead
In a few years Wi-Fi 6E will be common, 6 GHz will be boring, and Wi-Fi 7 will be the next big thing. The Wi-Fi 7 spec is still being written, but it’s likely to support 320 MHz channels, higher lever 4096-QAM modulation, and multi-gigabit performance. The next Wi-Fi standard will take better advantage of 6 GHz. For now, it’s an open playground for RF nerds (besides those pesky satellites).

dzmv2f,networking,1574358170.0,"I've been in the IT industry (mostly in networking) for 23 years. In that time, I've experienced all levels of dysfunction and mismanagement, and I was wondering today ""how would you fix this stuff from a managerial/operational level, and a technical level""?

Here are the biggest issues:

1. CIOs and CTOs not willing to help their employees succeed, give them the right tool and resources, or supporting them when things get difficult. This has been an epidemic problem since I've been in the industry. I tell my CIO or delivery executive about lack of staffing, scope creep, and looming emergencies, and the response has almost always been something to the effect of ""just figure it out"", or ""write up a procedure"" --as if writing up a f\*\*\*ing procedure is going to solve the issue.
2. Upper-level management talks about ""coverage"" without considering the skill level of staff, their availability, or the scope of potential work. In other words, the question becomes ""who is going to be on-call at 2am? Bob? OK!"" --even though Bob doesn't have the skill level to do anything substantive, and has limited availability after-hours. Likewise, upper-level management institutes a ""call chain"" rather than implementing a NOC and staffing it properly. ""Hey, why do we need a NOC for this 20,000 user environment when we can just put together a 3 person call chain to handle everything? Do w have Bob's personal cell phone number? Put it on the chain!""
3. The business-side of the house thinks they understand IT, and assume that the IT guys don't understand anything about the business, or could make recommendations on how to run things. The IT guys are just code monkeys or back-end engineers, and the IT department is an expense, not an asset or instrumental element in business profitability. 
4. Overseas outsourcing, which results in poor-quality work, huge turnover, security risks, and logistical problems. I know one guy whose meetings are at 3am every morning because his developers are in China.
5. Meetings with the CIO/CTO in which that individual simply yells at the IT staff, doesn't ask for input or recommendations, and pretends as though he or she understands all the technology--when that clearly isn't the case. In addition to this, meetings that are unproductive, in which nothing strategic or technical is figured out. 
6. The assumption that all hours of the day are of equal value. My boss likes to tell me, ""if you need to work from 2am to 5am, simply leave early the next day"" --as if those hours are equal. No, they fu\*\*ing aren't. 
7. Failure to decommission old systems and applications, and simply adding new stuff to the mix. Now the IT staff is supporting 300% more stuff than 4 years ago. A problem? Nah, Cindy still needs that 16 bit home-grown database, so it stays in the Hyper-V cluster, and Bob can troubleshoot it when it messes up.

The purpose of this is not to rant, but to hear from you guys/gals --how do we fix this stuff?

c36gpo,networking,1561093828.0,"TLDR: When an AT&T tech asks you if you would like to use the restroom inside the Central Office, you take that opportunity. 

I am a Network Engineer for a 110 branch public library system in Central California, this includes having two branches in Yosemite National Park.  One of the branches is on the valley floor hidden away in a residential area; most people miss it and it’s not open on the weekends as it mostly services park employees. I was there today with two AT&T techs working on bringing up a new T1 line. We ended up leaving the site without the new T1 working due to a screw up on AT&Ts end. The new circuit was installs long enough ago that someone took it down because it didn’t have a router connected to make it active. 

On the way out the door one of the AT&T techs said he was going to drop by the CO to use the restroom and gave me an offer to use it as well. I could not pass up this offer and I purposely ignored the fact that the little Yosemite library does have a restroom. The CO was right down the road so it was a short walk. 

The CO was bigger than excepted and of course you wouldn’t know what the building was if you walked right by it. Yosemite Valley is so remote that everything: T1s, POTS lines, DSL, and cell service are all backhauled up and out of the valley over microwave. No copper trunk lines, no fiber. Most of AT&T’s microwave network was replaced with fiber a long time ago, but not here, the NPS won’t let them run fiber into the park.

13dm7i8,networking,1683713672.0,"Just thought I'd put something out here for people to share information. We've been in constant escalation for the past 23 hours. Every Cisco TAC engineer had 21 customers assigned at some point in time.

A certificate on the TPM chip of the vEdge 100 / 1000 / 2000 has expired and seemed to have caught Cisco and customers by surprise. All vEdge based SD-WAN customers are sitting on a time bomb, watching the clock with sweaty palms, waiting for their companies WAN to implode and / or figuring out how to re-architect their WAN to maintain connectivity. The default timers for OMP graceful restart are 12 hours (can be set to 7 days) and the IPSEC rekey timers are 24 hours by default (can be set to 14 days). The deadline for the data plane to be torn down with the default timers is nearing. Originally Cisco published a recommendation to change these timers to the maximum values, but they withdrew that recommendation in a later update. Here is what we did:

1. Created a backdoor into every vEdge so we can still access it (enable SSH / Strong username/password).
2. Updated graceful restart / ipsec rekey timers with Cisco (lost 15 sites in the process but provided more time / increased the survivability of the other sites).
3. Using the backdoor we're building manual IPSEC tunnels to the cloud / data centers.
4. Working with the BU / Cisco execs to find out next steps.

We heard the BU was trying to find a controller based fix so customers wouldn't have to update all vEdge routers. A more recent update seemed to indicate that a new certificate is expected to be the best solution. They last posted a public update at 11pm PST and committed to having a new update posted 4 hours later. It's now 5 hours later and nothing has been posted as of yet.

Please no posts around how your SD-WAN solution is better. Only relevant experiences / rants / rumors / solutions. Thank you.

[https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/220448-identify-vedge-certificate-expired-on-ma.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/220448-identify-vedge-certificate-expired-on-ma.html)

UPDATE1 (2pm PST 05/10/23): We upgraded the controllers to 20.6.5.2 which resolved the issue for us. I'd recommend you reach out to TAC. Routers that were down sometimes lost the board-id and wouldn't automatically reestablish connectivity. We fixed this by removing NTP and setting the date back a couple of days. This re-established the connectivity and allowed us to put NTP back.

UPDATE2: (9PM PST 05/10/23): We started dropping all BFD sessions after about 6-7 hours of stability post controller upgrade. The sites AND vEdge CLOUD routers were dropping left and right and we pulled in one of Cisco's top resources. He asked us to upgrade and we went from 20.3.5 to 20.6.5 which didn't fix it. We then upgraded to 20.6.5.2 (which has the certificate included) and that fixed the issue. Note - we never lost control connections, only the BFD for some reason). We performed a global upgrade on all cloud and physical vEdge routers. The router that we upgraded to 20.6.5 reverted to 20.3.5 and couldn't establish control connections anymore. We set the date to May 6th which brought the control connections back up. All vEdge hardware and software routers needed to be upgraded in our environment. Be aware!!!

UPDATE3: (6AM PST 05/12/23): We've been running stable and without any further surprises since Update 2. Fingers crossed it will stay that way. I wanted to raise people's attention that Cisco is continuing to provide new updates to the [link](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/220448-identify-vedge-certificate-expired-on-ma.html) provided earlier. Please keep your eye on changes. Some older recommendations reversed based on new findings. i.e. Cisco is no longer recommending customers seeking a 20.3.x release to use the 20.3.3.2, 20.3.5.1, 20.3.4.3 releases. Only 20.3.7.1 is now recommended in the 20.3 release train due to customers that ran into the following bug resulting in data / packet loss: [https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd46600](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd46600)",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/13dm7i8/vedgeviptela_based_sdwan_problem_impacting_all/,vEdge/Viptela based SD-WAN problem impacting all customers worldwide,Other,247,144,0.97

----


I've been talking about Infrastructure as Code / Automation / Python a lot with colleagues and peers so I figured I may as well make a quick intro to ansible post since it is just too hot out today.

I'll preface this by saying, this is only really covered exam wise in the CCIE Written and possibly the cloud track but I figure it might be neat to see. If this is decently well received I might continue on and look at some of the other Evolving Technologies in the written. 

Today I'm playing with Ansible 2.4 on a Centos 7 server. The topology isn't especially relevant so I'm just running some Cisco and Juniper routers to play with.

So what's Ansible? Ansible is a agentless and python based configuration management platform that we can use to configure network devices and servers based on a playbook that contains a bunch of instructions.

I'm not going to go very deep here so this is more of a kicking the tires since ansible can get pretty complex and has its own red hat lab exam.

#DNS

To make things a bit easier we'll start out by making some host entries so we can work with hostnames instead of IP addresses.

    [root@centos01 /]# cat /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
    ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
    
    10.10.21.111 r01.testlab.com
    10.10.21.112 r02.testlab.com
    10.10.21.113 r03.testlab.com
    10.10.21.114 r04.testlab.com
    10.10.21.115 r05.testlab.com
    10.10.21.116 r06.testlab.com

    10.10.21.250 sw01.testlab.com
    10.10.21.251 sw02.testlab.com
    10.10.21.252 sw03.testlab.com
    10.10.21.253 sw04.testlab.com

    10.10.2.56    vmx01.testlab.com


#Ansible Config

Ansible by default will make sure the system knows about all the SSH keys it connects to, since this can be a pain when automating stuff I'm just going to disable the feature in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

`host_key_checking = False`
`host_key_auto_add = True`


#Ansible Hosts

Next we define the routers into groups under `/etc/ansible/hosts`, the hosts file supports ranges so r01 to r06 would be written as `r0[1:6]` we can get a bit more complex but lets not get too ahead of ourselves. When we make a playbook we will call the groups we want to run actions against.

    [cisco_routers]
    r0[1:6].testlab.com

    [cisco_switches]
    sw0[1:4].testlab.com

    [juniper]
    vmx01.testlab.com

We can also set default values for connections in the vars section.

    [cisco_routers:vars]
    ansible_connection=local
    ansible_ssh_user=admin
    ansible_ssh_pass=meowcat
    
    [juniper:vars]
    ansible_connection=local
    ansible_ssh_user=admin
    ansible_ssh_pass=Meowcat!!!


#Module and CLI

Ansible has a ton of default modules that do various tasks, as of 2.4 there are just under 1200 built-in modules that do everything from add configuration to Cisco routers to spinning up a cloud environment in AWS to setting up a 3 tier application on a bunch of servers.

    [root@centos01 ansible]# ansible-doc -l | wc -l
    1193
    
If we want to run a simple module we can just do it straight from the command line in ad hoc mode, here is an example of the `ping` module which verifies ansible can connect to everything in  a group.

    [root@centos01 ansible]# ansible cisco_routers -m ping   
    r05.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }
    r04.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }
    r02.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }
    r01.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }
    r03.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }
    r06.testlab.com | SUCCESS => {
        ""changed"": false, 
        ""failed"": false, 
        ""ping"": ""pong""
    }

Though you'll tend to get more value by doing a proper playbook.

#Credentials

To make things a bit more modular we will add the login information to a file called secrets.yaml, most ansible files are in YAML, it is a simple language for assigning values. It is very white space sensitive, it also does not support the tab key so make sure you always just use spaces to get the indentation you want.

    [root@centos01 ansible]# cat secrets.yaml 
    ---
    creds:
       username: admin
       password: meowcat
       auth_pass: meowcat


#Our first playbook!

Our first playbook is going to do a few things

    [root@centos01 ansible]# cat cisco-router.yaml 
    ---
    - hosts: cisco_routers
      gather_facts: yes
      connection: local 
    
    
      tasks:
      - name: GET CREDENTIALS
        include_vars: secrets.yaml
    
      - name: DEFINE CONNECTION
        set_fact:
           connection:
              authorize: yes
              host: ""{{ inventory_hostname }}""
              username: ""{{ creds['username'] }}""
              password: ""{{ creds['password'] }}""
              auth_pass: ""{{ creds['auth_pass'] }}""
    
      - name: RUN SHOW INTERFACES 
        ios_command:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          commands:
             - show ip interface brief
        register: ipbrief
    
      - debug: var=ipbrief.stdout_lines

Let's break down what we are doing here.

    ---
    - hosts: cisco_routers
      gather_facts: no
      connection: local 

The first section tells ansible what `hosts` we are running the playbook against, in this case it is the Cisco routers group.
Ansible can optionally query the device to get various information like the device's hostname and OS level but we'll disable `gather_facts` for now to save some time. There is actually vendor specific fact modules that we can use if we want info on the system, for example Cisco would use `ios_facts`

Lastly we set the connection to `local` which means it will use OpenSSH to connect to the routers. We can also set it to be `paramiko` if you want it to use the python ssh instead. There are a few other options as well that we don't need to touch on today.

The rest of our playbook is the tasks that are going to be run. Each task has a name followed by an action. The GET CREDENTIALS task just reads our secrets.yaml file to get our passwords.

          tasks:
          - name: GET CREDENTIALS
            include_vars: secrets.yaml

Next we tell ansible how to connect to the routers, I like to put this info in a DEFINE CONNECTIONS task to make it easier going forward. This section defines various variables that we can use in our other tasks.

      - name: DEFINE CONNECTION
        set_fact:
           connection:
              authorize: yes
              host: ""{{ inventory_hostname }}""
              username: ""{{ creds['username'] }}""
              password: ""{{ creds['password'] }}""
              auth_pass: ""{{ creds['auth_pass'] }}""


Lastly we will have ansible run `show ip interface brief` on each of my six routers. To do this we run the `ios_command` module and tell it to use our connection provider we just made above. We need to add the provider to each command since ansible will connect to the router to execute each step though this behavior has recently changed in newer versions.  To save the output we use the `register` keyword to save the output as a variable and then we use the `debug` command to display it on the screen.

      - name: RUN SHOW INTERFACES 
        ios_command:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          commands:
             - show ip interface brief
        register: ipbrief
    
      - debug: var=ipbrief.stdout_lines


#Our First Playbook's output

Once our playbook is done we run it with the `ansible-playbook` command, it will run through each of the steps and display our `show ip interface brief` output. If you are following along and you are seeing errors, check your whitespace, ansible can be pretty picky until you get used to it.

# Making a change

Viewing some show commands is cool but what about making a change. In this example we'll push a MGMT ACL to each of our Cisco routers.

          commands:

            - ip access-group ACL_MGMT in
          parents: ['interface g1']
          match: exact

Let's examine what we are doing from where we left off. First we'll run another show command to see if there are any ACLs on the boxes. This uses the same logic as above.

      - name: CHECK ACLS
        ios_command:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          commands:
             - show ip access-list
        register: beforeacl
    
      - debug: var=beforeacl.stdout_lines

Next we use the `ios_config` module to delete ACL_MGMT if it exists and then push a new ACL with my LAN networks in it.

      - name: CREATE MGMT ACL
        ios_config:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          lines:
            - 10 permit ip 10.10.13.0 0.0.0.255 any
            - 20 permit ip 10.10.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
            - 30 permit ip 10.10.21.0 0.0.0.255 any
            - 40 deny ip any any log
          parents: ['ip access-list extended ACL_MGMT']
          before: ['no ip access-list extended ACL_MGMT']
          match: exact

Lastly we'll check our work and apply the ACL to my CSR's mgmt interfaces.

      - name: CHECK MGMT ACLS
        ios_command:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          commands:
             - show ip access-list ACL_MGMT
        register: afteracl
    
      - debug: var=afteracl.stdout_lines
    
      - name: APPLY MGMT ACL
        ios_config:
          provider: ""{{ connection }}""
          lines:
            - ip access-group ACL_MGMT in
          parents: ['interface g1']
          match: exact

Once it is done we can see the ACL is created and applied on the router, notice the output lists the number of changes that happens in the play through.

#What about other vendors?

We can use the exact same logic to push configuration to a Juniper router as well only instead of ios modules we are using junos modules.
In this playbook we'll check the routing table and then enable OSPF. Because I'm just doing one router I'm not using a credentials file and will just put the login directly in the playbook.

Here’s the longer version: I’ve got a good job, a great schedule, and a supportive boss. I’m the sole person responsible for the operation and performance of a mutli-site enterprise network.

At the same time, I have about 1000 internal users who are convinced I don’t know what I’m doing, including powerful decision-makers above my boss.

Nearly all of the issues our staff runs into are run-of-the-mill remote web server anomalies, user-created circumstances (hasn’t rebooted in four months or has 9 billion tabs open), or our user has very dated hardware (devices with 5200rpm HDDs, 2.4 GHz-only WLAN adapters, hasn’t been re-images in 5+ years). But to our users, these are all “network” issues indicative of an incompetent IT staff and our network is slow and broken and never works.

I know the obvious solution here is data, data, and more data, but these aren’t people who are willing to even consider listening to a layman’s explanation of any data I collect. I’ve tried to keep my head down and block out the noise, but the constant barrage of criticism is demoralizing and it’s really starting to eat away at my confidence.

79qylf,networking,1509399627.0,"Well after working for IBM (Boulder) off and on throughout the years. I'm finally over it! Since they never actually hire anybody, only contractors of course these jobs I've had with them. I've been a Network Engineer for about 9 years now. Mostly operations, support, etc. on Cisco switches, routers, firewalls.

Oh boy where do I start (long rant coming).
1. They are way too big and complicated. Both their network infrastructure, and the way they manage their business.

2. You spend 80% of your time on non-technical things. For example, change control is an incredible maze you must suffer through. Some of the customers I supported had different change ticket mgt systems. Not only that, but you need a law degree to create/manage changes on some poorly house-made system.

3. Access to these customers was another problem! Always had access issues in order to support their customers. For example, it would take at least 1 month for complete access on new customers! Submit this form, get it to the manager, they approve it. Then it goes to another group, and on a on and on. Then I would get contacted by the project manager, that I filled something on the form wrong. Reject it, and I would have to resubmit it again. Or someone in India would drop the ball, and I would have to ask my manager to see why I still don't have access to the new customer. Mind boggling.

4. They are constantly changing the teams that support these customers. For example, when I'm on sev 1 outage from a customer, sometimes it would take 1-2 hrs just to find out what server team is responsible. I would be on some calls with like 20 different people! And when I would ask, ""I need the server  team for Macy's"" or ""I need someone at the datacenter with hands on to locate the equipment"". One person would say, oh that went to India, no wait. The problem with the India support, is nobody knows anything, communication is horrible (forget conference calls, only IM messaging). And about 90% of the time it was never on the network side, after my troubleshooting. Come to find out, that this was a new server install (linux) wrong IP address, etc. or just wrong build sheet from server team.

5. Sometimes I would get calls in the middle of the night, from India of course, asking me if I support such and such. I say no I don't support that customer, and they ask me if I know who does. I tell them ""hell if I know, but quit calling me"".

6. They use Lotus Notes still for their email. nuff said.

7. They use socks servers for ssh access. nuff said.

8. They use old equipment, some 6509s that are 10 years old. nuff said.

9. At the boulder facility, its like a ghost town. There's about 9 buildings, datacenters in each one, and nobody is their. Seriously its depressing to look at. Most of the IBM'ers have been their for like 20 years, bunch of old farts walking around. Don't get me wrong, most of them are very friendly, so were the people that I worked with on my team. But another problem was the constant changing of managers. On the last 4 year contract I just ended, I went through 3 managers.

Ok their much much more to complain about, but this was all the top issues I had to deal with.

Why did I take the punishment for so long? Well the work load was fairly easy. But it got worse and worse over time, they start making me take un-paid furlough days off. Then the straw that broke my back was they wanted to reduce my hourly rate by $4. I finally told my contract corp (Artech) that they were breaking the contract I had with them. And they agreed to end the contract due to lack of work.

Ok so I'm just curious, anybody else here work/contract at IBM? Or another company with similar issues?

hrqh9b,networking,1594829619.0,"A few friends have encouraged me to post stuff like this as they found it helpful. Most posts are are of a technical nature, but the hardest part of being a lead NE isn't technical.

Communication, Budgeting, planning equipment refreshes, outage management, project management are key skills to being a lead NE.

I'd like to contribute what I believe are key phrases and concepts to survive as an NE in any environment. While I worked at VARs and an ISP, most of my XP is at an enterprise. So that is who this is targeted at.

**How to buy time during a Network Outage;**

People outright panic during outages as we know. I've been cursed at by CIOs, PMs, my own Manager when these have occurred. What you have to convey during this time is a calm, ""just the facts"" demeanor that acknowledges the issue and their concerns while notifying them you're working on it.

Example phrases to use when this happens.

* ""We're aware of the issue and still investigating the root cause, updates every 45 minutes""
* ""We're aware of the issue and working with the vendor to resolve it""
* ""We're still investigating the issue and have no ETA but will keep you updated.""
* ""We've identified the issue and are working to resolve it as soon as possible, multiple vendors are engaged.""
* \*More corporate speak phrases [here](https://github.com/neilthecellist/Statuspage2English) thanks u/neilthecellist

**If you don't at minimum acknowledge the issue and** ***their feelings things will go downhill, fast.***\*\*, it makes it harder on everyone. It shouldn't work like this, but it does usually.\*\*

**Once the outage is over**

Control the narrative (or it'll be controlled for you). Ideally one person should be dedicated to technical problem solving and another should be responding and communicating. Typically two conference bridges can help with this (one for the technical folks, the other for the big wig business people). 

In more toxic environment, they're looking for a vendor, person, or ISP to blame/fire. In others they want to understand root cause to prevent it in the future. This is actually an opportunity sometimes.

\*Consider putting these into a pre-canned email and sending them out, thanks u/s0m3f00l 

Assuming the outage wasn't fatfinger related.

**Explain, and build relationships**

You can tie this back to your yearly architecture reviews and budget requests. ""X failed because my funding was cut for Y refresh"", ""We requested an outage window to update this devices old code, but none was given"". If you can tie the technical failure back to your challenges with your business it can give them motivation to listen to you and fund you appropriately. If they don't care, that's pretty much a red flag and you need to bounce. Companies like that usually end up relying on VARs tbh.

As part of your yearly budget requests, and architecture reviews you need to identify all of the areas where equipment is under-designed, needs redundancy or refresh. If they don't fund your requests, and you have no options, you need to convey the risk in a respectful manner. This is key post outage.

Lastly,

Don't take it personally, people get mean when the network goes down. Especially at Hospitals and Financial Institutions. Do a Headspace, take some CBD, and don't let the VPs, Middle Managers, and Yes-men, push all the blame on you and leave you out to dry. That's assuming you follow process around changes, communicate and set expectations around outages and listen to your peers.

I was just about to set it up when someone told me about Oxidized, which I looked into and set up. I searched around here and see a handful of posts about this stuff I intend to read.

For monitoring/graphing purposes, I've always like Cacti and used it, but recently I've also discovered LibreNMS + Observium (yes, I know that they are separate projects etc and one is based off of the other). I'm familiar with PRTG too

What are some other must haves you have that might be useful to others?  Like your swiss army knife, but of software. I'm just starting to get into the network side of things and loving it.

Fast forward 15 years in the future, right now in 2020 I work as an allround network engineer for a small organization (around 1300 staff), but I feel like I’m actually a security engineer. Sure, I manage routers, switches and wireless LAN controllers, but 90% of my time I’m busy with security related tasks. Updating vulnerable network (management) operating systems, tightening firewall policy’s, organizing pen tests, explaining to management if we’re vulnerable to new threats that the media reports about, and so on. Because I’m responsible for the firewall, I sometimes lie awake at night wondering if I didn’t accidentally misconfigure something that leaves one of our systems vulnerable. 

I just realized that I never asked for any of these security related tasks. They just get handed to the network engineer, because the network is what hackers use gain access to an IT infrastructure. I’m not sure I like the way my job has evolved the past decade to be honest.

- Git - ""let's put our configs into git and version control them!"". This includes, but is not limited to, using Issues/PRs in github for submitting network changes.

- Ansible - because that's what everyone cool is using. So learn about playbooks, roles, custom-modules, ansible-vaults, etc

- Jinja - Because putting full router config into git is too 2000s
- Python - because of course, some stuff is just easier in python or hey, god forbid you don't have the right already-made module in Ansible

- Docker/Kubernetes - because how are you going to validate your new network changes? Spin up some [docker containers](https://github.com/plajjan/vrnetlab) containing various virtual OS which work through some convoluted TCP socket piping that expose console/ssh ports *who the hell knows how*

- Jenkins/Gitlab CI - because how are you going to setup your dev/prod environments

- Oh yeah, meanwhile please also look into all this new network-related stuff such as Netconf, REST APIs, YAML/JSON, YANG Models, SD-WAN... and 100s of other things.

Yes, this might have come off as a rant, but seriously, how do you go about learning all of this stuff?

Then it was decided that I should do OS updates on all our routers and switches.  I went through, site by site, upgrading things and everything was going just fine.  Then I had a switch stack that didn't come back up after reboot.  After digging into it and doing some troubleshooting, the issue was a license problem.  The switches decided that they weren't properly licensed and stopped passing traffic.

Long story short, it turns out he had bought the gear from some unknown company.  The switches were on some sort of blacklist and that's why they were bricked.  Since I didn't know this, I had reached out to Cisco for support and now they know my company had these switches.

So I'm wondering...aside from us having to scramble to get replacement switches installed, will there be any further consequences of this?  Either for my boss, me personally, or the company?

    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ for x in {1..5}; do dohost ""conf t ; interface l$x ; ip address 10.0.0.$x 255.255.255.255"" ; done
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ 
                               *Jul  4 22:32:39.252: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Loopback1, changed state to up

    *Jul  4 22:32:39.567: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Loopback5, changed state to up

Now that we have some interfaces we can run show commands.

    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ dohost 'show ip route'

The benefit of this command is that while the `terminal shell` I talked about ages ago brought some linux utilities into the mix, this allows the full Redhat CLI into the mix. So for example if I wanted to change all the 10 routes in the output (for some reason) I could. 

    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ dohost 'show ip route' | sed 's/10/20/g'

Or if I wanted to display just the IPs from the `show ip route` output we could do something like this:

    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ dohost 'show ip route' | awk '{match($0,/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/); ip = substr($0,RSTART,RLENGTH); print ip}' | sort

#Python on the Box

This also gives us python directly on the box like we have with Nexus.

In addition to the standard python modules, guestshell comes with a `cli` module that lets us access the router directly. Also since guestshell is linux we can install applications and modules as we need to.

We can use the `cli` command to run commands.

    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ python                                    
    Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)

    Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
    >>> from cli import *
    
    >>> z = cli('show ip int br')
    >>> print z

    Loopback1              10.0.0.1        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback2              10.0.0.2        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback3              10.0.0.3        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback4              10.0.0.4        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback5              10.0.0.5        YES manual up                    up      
    VirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES NVRAM  up                    up      
    
If you just want to view the output you can use the 'clip' command to display the standard output without saving any data.

    >>> clip('show ip int br')
    
    Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol

    GigabitEthernet2       unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively down down    
    GigabitEthernet3       unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively down down    
    Loopback1              10.0.0.1        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback2              10.0.0.2        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback3              10.0.0.3        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback4              10.0.0.4        YES manual up                    up      
    Loopback5              10.0.0.5        YES manual up                    up      
    VirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES NVRAM  up                    up      
    
    
We can use a simple loop to make things like pinging things easier.
    
    >>> for x in range(1,6):
    ...     clip('ping 10.0.0.' + str(x))
    ... 
    
    Type escape sequence to abort.
    Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.1, timeout is 2 seconds:
    !!!!!
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
    
    
    Type escape sequence to abort.
    Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.2, timeout is 2 seconds:
    !!!!!
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
    
    
    Type escape sequence to abort.
    Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.3, timeout is 2 seconds:
    !!!!!
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms
    
    
    Type escape sequence to abort.
    Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.4, timeout is 2 seconds:
    !!!!!
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
    
    
    Type escape sequence to abort.
    Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.0.0.5, timeout is 2 seconds:
    !!!!!
    Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/1 ms
    

Since it is a full python shell we can mix and match modules as needed.

    >>> from cli import *
    >>> import re
    >>> for x in range(1,6):
    ...     output = cli('ping 10.0.0.' + str(x))
    ...     icmp_regex_pattern = r""100 percent""
    ...     icmp_success = True if re.search(icmp_regex_pattern, output, re.MULTILINE) else False
    ...     if icmp_success:
    ...             print ""Loopback"" + str(x) + "" Works!!!""
    ...     else:
    ...             print ""Loopback"" + str(x) + "" IS DRUNK!!!""
    ... 
    Loopback1 Works!!!
    Loopback2 Works!!!
    Loopback3 Works!!!
    Loopback4 Works!!!
    Loopback5 IS DRUNK!!!

The cli command can also string various IOS commands together as well as use variables.

    
    >>> SLASH32 = '255.255.255.255'
    >>> cli('conf t ; interface l6 ; ip address 10.0.0.6 ' + SLASH32)
    ''
    >>> clip('show run int l6')
    
    Building configuration...
    Current configuration : 64 bytes
    !
    interface Loopback6
     ip address 10.0.0.6 255.255.255.255
    end
    
We'll wrap this up by talking about configuration changes, if we are pushing a lot of configuration it can be easier to use the `configure` or `configurep` commands which takes a configuration block that is stored in a variable. First we'll make a variable to that contains the commands needed to add a loopback and enable OSPF on it.
    
        >>> MEOW = '''interface l7
        ...             ip address 10.0.0.7 255.255.255.255
        ...             description Added by Python
        ...             router ospf 1
        ...             network 10.0.0.7 0.0.0.0 area 7'''
        >>> 
        >>> configurep(MEOW)
        Line 1 SUCCESS: interface l7
        Line 2 SUCCESS:   ip address 10.0.0.7 255.255.255.255
        Line 3 SUCCESS:   description Added by Python
        Line 4 SUCCESS:   router ospf 1
        Line 5 SUCCESS:   network 10.0.0.7 0.0.0.0 area 7
    

Since we are pushing more commands we will want to setup exceptions so the script knows how to handle errors. I've edited the MEOW variable to add another loopback with a typo in the IP.
    
        >>> MEOW = '''interface l7
        ...                         ip address 10.0.0.7 255.255.255.255
        ...                        description Added by Python
        ...                        router ospf 1
        ...                        network 10.0.0.7 0.0.0.0 area 7
        ...                    interface l8
        ...                         ip address 10.0.0.0.8 255.255.255.255
        ...                         description FAILURE!!!'''
    
Now we can setup an exception that will return any failed commands.
    
        >>> try:
        ...     results = configure(MEOW)
        ...     print ""Success!""
        ... except CLIConfigurationError as e:
        ...     print ""Failed configurations:""
        ...     for failure in e.failed:
        ...             print failure
        ... 
        Failed configurations:
        Line 7 FAILURE:       ip add 10.0.0.0.8 255.255.255.255 (PARSE_ERROR_NOMATCH)
        **CLI Line # 7: ip add 10.0.0.0.8 255.255.255.255
        **CLI Line # 7:                      ^
        **CLI Line # 7: % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
    

Lastly we can run scripts by saving them to a file and either running them from the shell or through the `guestshell run` command. This lets us have things like EEM call scripts as part of a larger solution.

pfyjnf,networking,1630516861.0,"About once every three months, we run a free course on Python for Network Engineers. Our next course starts on Tuesday, September 7th.

You can sign-up here:

[https://pynet.twb-tech.com/free-python-course.html](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/free-python-course.html)

The course syllabus is as follows:  
- Week1 - Why Python, the Python Interpreter Shell, and Strings
- Week2 - Numbers, Files, Lists, and Linters
- Week3 - Conditionals and Loops
- Week4 - Dictionaries, Exceptions, and Regular Expressions
- Week5 - Functions and the Python Debugger
- Week6 - Netmiko Basics
- Week7 - Jinja2 Basics, Introduction to YAML and JSON, Complex Data Structures
- Week8 - Libraries, Package Installation, and Virtual Environments

The course covers Python fundamentals from a network engineer's perspective.

So it covers Python basics using examples and exercises that would be generally familiar to a network engineer. It is definitely a beginners course and doesn't assume any existing Python knowledge.

Towards the end of the course I transition into applying Python to Network Engineering (Netmiko and Jinja2). This is definitely a minor part of the course, however, relative to the Python fundamentals content.

The course format is a lesson a week for eight weeks. The lessons come out every Tuesday morning (U.S. Pacific time). The lessons consist of videos, exercises, and additional content.

A bit about myself, I am the creator and maintainer of the Python Netmiko library and also do a reasonable amount of work on both the NAPALM and Nornir projects. I am a long-time network engineer and have been into network automation for several years now.

If you have any questions about this course, ask away.

– Newdles commented:

– herro9n commented:

There were also constructive/positive comments regarding FS. Overall, I personally like FS, their availability and hardware has worked well for us, though I understand some people have reservations regarding the origins of their OS software, and issues with TAA.

Today, I was contacted by an FS representative (Fitz9099Mon) via Reddit private message. I'm a firm believer in transparency regarding requests to remove/redact/etc. posts on the internet that could potentially remove valuable information for others. So I'm posting this update to include the request made by FS regarding my previous thread.

I've created some pretty nice Visio diagrams but it takes forever I often forget to update them.    

I went out looking for some existing applications that could diagram the network automatically but came up short.  There were some, but they were either way too expensive or generally didn't fit what I was looking for.  
  
So I decided to make my own.
  
It's written in python and creates a DOT (png) output diagram.
  
It currently can pull this information together and include it in the diagram:

* All devices (via CDP)
* Interface names
* IP addresses
* VLAN memberships
* Etherchannel memberships (LACP only)
* Identify trunk links
* Identify switched links
* Identify routed links
* BGP Local AS
* OSPF Router ID
* HSRP Virtual IP
* HSRP Priority
* VSS Domain
* Stackwise membership

[Here's an output example.](http://i.imgur.com/BuXnzWG.png)  
  
https://github.com/MJL85/mnet  
  
It currently only supports SNMPv2.  Since it discovers the network using CDP it's geared towards Cisco environments.
  
Here's the command to get you started:
`# mnet-graph.py -r 10.10.10.1 -d 20 -f network.svg -t ""COMPANY<br />CITY, STATE<br />NETWORK DIAGRAM""`

This morning shortly after I sat down at my desk I tried to answer a phone call and got an error.  The phone system couldn't reach my phone.  I immediately tried to SSH into my HP switch to cycle the power on the phone (it's just easier than pulling the phone out and pulling the cable, right?), but I couldn't connect to my switch.  Which is when I noticed my uplink port was dead.

Long story short, I found through trial and error that the Cisco port was locked at 1000, Full, and the HP switch was set to 1000-Auto.  It would not let me hard code it to 1000-Full, and for some reason if I set both interfaces to Auto, I was only syncing up at 100-Full.

After about an hour of trying different port configurations and even upgrading the firmware on my little HP switch, I finally decided to try a different cable from the wall to the HP switch.  Lo and behold, it auto sync's up at 1000-Full.  

An hour and 15 minutes after I was supposed to start my day, I was finally cable tying the new cable into place, just because I was reluctant to consider that a cable which has gone untouched and is routed through furniture, would suddenly just go bad.

&#x200B;

I have a lot of printers that are being installed in the next few months, so I made a script to change VLANs based on the vendor MAC address of the devices. I've also used this to quickly put computer labs or APs in the same networks.

If you think you could use this, please feel free to check it out here: [github.com/robschn/mac-change-vlan](https://github.com/robschn/mac-change-vlan)

## Usage

1. Enter the vendor MAC of the devices. This is the first 6 of a MAC address and must be in Cisco format, HHHH.HH.
2. Enter what VLAN you want all the devices to be in.
3. Enter the IP of the switch the devices are connected to.

&#8203;

    Vendor MAC for the devices. Must be HHHH.HH format: 0000.0c
    VLAN would you like the devices to be in: 10
    IP of the switch the devices connect to: 192.168.1.1

Once you log in, the script will run a search for devices containing the vendor MAC. If a device is already in the VLAN you specified, it will not be added to the list.

    Username: cisco
    Password: 
    
    Logging in now...

Google just released their RCA/post-mortem of the events that impacted several US and Americas GCP regions as well as other Google services on Sunday, June 2nd 2019. I found it to be a highly interesting read. Quoting below to save folks a click:

&#x200B;

>**ISSUE SUMMARY**  
>  
>On Sunday 2 June, 2019, Google Cloud projects running services in multiple US regions experienced elevated packet loss as a result of network congestion for a duration of between 3 hours 19 minutes, and 4 hours 25 minutes. The duration and degree of packet loss varied considerably from region to region and is explained in detail below. Other Google Cloud services which depend on Google's US network were also impacted, as were several non-Cloud Google services which could not fully redirect users to unaffected regions. Customers may have experienced increased latency, intermittent errors, and connectivity loss to instances in us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west2, northamerica-northeast1, and southamerica-east1. Google Cloud instances in us-west1, and all European regions and Asian regions, did not experience regional network congestion.  
>  
>Google Cloud Platform services were affected until mitigation completed for each region, including: Google Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Endpoints, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, Cloud Console, Stackdriver Metrics, Cloud Pub/Sub, Bigquery, regional Cloud Spanner instances, and Cloud Storage regional buckets. G Suite services in these regions were also affected.  
>  
>We apologize to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. A detailed assessment of impact is at the end of this report.  
>  
>**ROOT CAUSE AND REMEDIATION**  
>  
>This was a major outage, both in its scope and duration. As is always the case in such instances, multiple failures combined to amplify the impact.  
>  
>Within any single physical datacenter location, Google's machines are segregated into multiple logical clusters which have their own dedicated cluster management software, providing resilience to failure of any individual cluster manager. Google's network control plane runs under the control of different instances of the same cluster management software; in any single location, again, multiple instances of that cluster management software are used, so that failure of any individual instance has no impact on network capacity.  
>  
>Google's cluster management software plays a significant role in automating datacenter maintenance events, like power infrastructure changes or network augmentation. Google's scale means that maintenance events are globally common, although rare in any single location. Jobs run by the cluster management software are labelled with an indication of how they should behave in the face of such an event: typically jobs are either moved to a machine which is not under maintenance, or stopped and rescheduled after the event.  
>  
>Two normally-benign misconfigurations, and a specific software bug, combined to initiate the outage: firstly, network control plane jobs and their supporting infrastructure in the impacted regions were configured to be stopped in the face of a maintenance event. Secondly, the multiple instances of cluster management software running the network control plane were marked as eligible for inclusion in a particular, relatively rare maintenance event type. Thirdly, the software initiating maintenance events had a specific bug, allowing it to deschedule multiple independent software clusters at once, crucially even if those clusters were in different physical locations.  
>  
>The outage progressed as follows: at 11:45 US/Pacific, the previously-mentioned maintenance event started in a single physical location; the automation software created a list of jobs to deschedule in that physical location, which included the logical clusters running network control jobs. Those logical clusters also included network control jobs in other physical locations. The automation then descheduled each in-scope logical cluster, including the network control jobs and their supporting infrastructure in multiple physical locations.  
>  
>Google's resilience strategy relies on the principle of defense in depth. Specifically, despite the network control infrastructure being designed to be highly resilient, the network is designed to 'fail static' and run for a period of time without the control plane being present as an additional line of defense against failure. The network ran normally for a short period - several minutes - after the control plane had been descheduled. After this period, BGP routing between specific impacted physical locations was withdrawn, resulting in the significant reduction in network capacity observed by our services and users, and the inaccessibility of some Google Cloud regions. End-user impact began to be seen in the period 11:47-11:49 US/Pacific.  
>  
>Google engineers were alerted to the failure two minutes after it began, and rapidly engaged the incident management protocols used for the most significant of production incidents. Debugging the problem was significantly hampered by failure of tools competing over use of the now-congested network. The defense in depth philosophy means we have robust backup plans for handling failure of such tools, but use of these backup plans (including engineers travelling to secure facilities designed to withstand the most catastrophic failures, and a reduction in priority of less critical network traffic classes to reduce congestion) added to the time spent debugging. Furthermore, the scope and scale of the outage, and collateral damage to tooling as a result of network congestion, made it initially difficult to precisely identify impact and communicate accurately with customers.  
>  
>As of 13:01 US/Pacific, the incident had been root-caused, and engineers halted the automation software responsible for the maintenance event. We then set about re-enabling the network control plane and its supporting infrastructure. Additional problems once again extended the recovery time: with all instances of the network control plane descheduled in several locations, configuration data had been lost and needed to be rebuilt and redistributed. Doing this during such a significant network configuration event, for multiple locations, proved to be time-consuming. The new configuration began to roll out at 14:03.  
>  
>In parallel with these efforts, multiple teams within Google applied mitigations specific to their services, directing traffic away from the affected regions to allow continued serving from elsewhere.  
>  
>As the network control plane was rescheduled in each location, and the relevant configuration was recreated and distributed, network capacity began to come back online. Recovery of network capacity started at 15:19, and full service was resumed at 16:10 US/Pacific time.  
>  
>The multiple concurrent failures which contributed to the initiation of the outage, and the prolonged duration, are the focus of a significant post-mortem process at Google which is designed to eliminate not just these specific issues, but the entire class of similar problems. Full details follow in the Prevention and Follow-Up section.  
>  
>**PREVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP**  
>  
>We have immediately halted the datacenter automation software which deschedules jobs in the face of maintenance events. We will re-enable this software only when we have ensured the appropriate safeguards are in place to avoid descheduling of jobs in multiple physical locations concurrently. Further, we will harden Google's cluster management software such that it rejects such requests regardless of origin, providing an additional layer of defense in depth and eliminating other similar classes of failure.  
>  
>Google's network control plane software and supporting infrastructure will be reconfigured such that it handles datacenter maintenance events correctly, by rejecting maintenance requests of the type implicated in this incident. Furthermore, the network control plane in any single location will be modified to persist its configuration so that the configuration does not need to be rebuilt and redistributed in the event of all jobs being descheduled. This will reduce recovery time by an order of magnitude. Finally, Google's network will be updated to continue in 'fail static' mode for a longer period in the event of loss of the control plane, to allow an adequate window for recovery with no user impact.  
>  
>Google's emergency response tooling and procedures will be reviewed, updated and tested to ensure that they are robust to network failures of this kind, including our tooling for communicating with the customer base. Furthermore, we will extend our continuous disaster recovery testing regime to include this and other similarly catastrophic failures.  
>  
>Our post-mortem process will be thorough and broad, and remains at a relatively early stage. Further action items may be identified as this process progresses.

gzxk5c,networking,1591740724.0,"Earlier today I wrapped up an interview. I'm more from a Sysadmin/support background and only started doing anything major with networking in the past year after doing some cloud support (mostly virtual fortigate and Cisco stuff; outside client support for IP policies, site-to-site tunnels, stuff like that).

This interview was for a network admin position that admittedly seemed outside my skill set but they were keen to proceed, so I went ahead with it. The gist is that they were moving over to fortigate from some old HP stuff and had recently added a new 1GB line. Their network is now working, but functioning very slowly, and they don't know why.

I was expecting maybe a network diagram, overview of the network, and to get an idea of how it is structured and subnetted, and kind of get a generalized view of the network to understand where potential bottlenecks might be and work from there.

Instead, the interview started out with the Fortigate's web interface open to the interfaces panel. They gave me control and asked me to figure out what was wrong. And having zero knowledge of the network at all, I was just like ""uh, I dunno."" I poked around a bit, noticed a bit of high latency DNS but nothing extreme. CPU and mem utilization were fairly low, and it had about 5k concurrent connections, and all seemed reasonable. No notable issues stood out to me with the limited knowledge available to review.

I said so, poked around a bit more into their policies and interfaces just to be sure, and that was it. 45 minute interview done in 15 minutes. They thanked me for my time and said that we'd reconvene at a later time.

The whole thing seemed really weird, and I gotta ask, was this just someone trying to get free networking assistance or something? It was just really odd, and there was barely any conversation, discussion on my technical background, or anything. 

It was so, so odd, but I've also never done an interview for a networking position before, so I'm not sure if this sort of thing might be a normal practice.

97l2rt,networking,1534360117.0,"Just got off the phone with Spectrum/Charter/TWC/Brighthouse/Whatever they are now.  Our BGP with them went down Tuesday at precisely 1AM.  Sounds fishy?  While you would prefer perfectly stable connections, it's pretty standard (in my experience) to have middle of the night random drops as providers perform maintenances without sending notifications. How professional!  The exact timing is a dead giveaway.

My colleague (he wants me to refer to him here as Chuck Finley) opened a ticket, and was immediately told it was a fiber cut.  Great!  Update us as it gets fixed.

No updates throughout the day, and Chuck calls back.  Now he's told it was an equipment migration.  Super, fix it.

We start escalating with account managers and breathing fire.  Chuck finds this in the logs:

%BGP-3-NOTIFICATION: sent to neighbor 192.0.2.1 active 2/2 (peer in wrong AS) 2 bytes 4E21

Yup, they botched their config.

He gets on the phone with them and gets them to fix this.  BGP neighborship comes up, we get our default route, but our outbound advertisements are still not being preferred over our backup that we prepend 6 freakin times.  Still escalating with account managers, who basically say ""we're going home for the night, good luck!""

This morning Chuck finds that we are no longer even receiving the default route, 0 prefixes received.  le sigh.

Calls them up yet again, and is told somehow they stopped giving us default and gave us Full Routes.  We filter everything but default inbound.  They put it back to default and we're up and running for outbound traffic, but route advertisements to them are still borked.  Chuck goes through all the config and asks me to hop on a conference call and double check.  I confirm the config is good on our end.

The Spectrum engineer says he's getting our routes prepended 3 times with 100 local preference.  That's odd, since our route-map to him just matches on our prefixes and doesn't set anything.  The only route-map that prepends 3 times also sets the local preference lower via communities.  Our config hasn't changed since the BGP relationship bounced multiple times, so it's not like some latent config is stuck in the works.  Just to humor him, I hard reset the BGP peering, and he claims the prepends went away.  OK fine, still has nothing to do with not preferring that route over a 6x prepend that goes through 2 other ASes.  While talking about that 6x prepend route he lets slip that the local pref on that route is 101.

**WHAT?**

It clicks that our local pref is only 100.  I pull up my 'Charter BGP guide' (probably old/legacy, but most providers are relatively consistent with local preference communities).  120 is default for customer routes, 100 for peers, 80 for transit.  He starts explaining about the new config standard they are pushing blah blah blah.  He even gets someone from the Standards team on the line.  I start questioning about why they are defaulting us to 100 and why, since local pref is significant within the AS, they are assigning our routes from transits to 101.  Blah blah new standards. I ask for their new BGP guide.  They have none, he's going to bring it up to the team and see if they can write something.  Gotta wait 2 weeks and ask my account manager.  He asks if either we can set 120 local pref via communities or he can have it hard coded.  I'm happy to set it and do, then soft reset.  Symptoms go away.  Now I get to wait and bring it up over and over again until they actually fix their broken standards.

**TLDR:**

Once you're on the 'new standards' Spectrum will now **by default** prefer ANY OTHER PATH to your routes, even if it goes from Slovakia to China to Russia to South Africa, then back to you over 92 AS hops rather than going over your direct fiber link with them.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but I feel like they just broke basic BGP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/97l2rt/warning_new_spectrum_bgp_standards/,"WARNING: New Spectrum BGP ""Standards""",,215,95,0.95

First off, thank you again to everyone who responded.  Reading your thoughts made me realize that I need to focus on the factors that I have control over.  I cannot change my family, but I could do something about my dead-end job at my company.  It finally hit me that they were never going to do anything about by position unless I threatened to leave.  So, I started looking.  Within a couple of months I found a job that was very close to home, and was able to negotiate a pay bump.  I gave my notice to my current manager, which I felt terrible for, as he was a great guy who was already stressed out.  

The next day I am called into our division VP’s office, asking where I wanted to work, and he would make it happen.  He also told me to give him a number for salary.  I acquiesced.   But by this point I did not want to stay, so I gave them a high number I knew they could not come up with.  I do miss working with a group of ‘A’ players, but looking back the place was a sinking ship (the VP who I greatly respected, has since left himself, and there have been two layoffs).  

Anyway, I am four months into the new job, and much less on edge.  As an added bonus I now have time to play with sandboxes at work, and even get a little study time in at lunch.  I have been able to develop my skills a lot more the Linux side, and after passing my NSX cert, I will start to learn Ansible.  My home situation has unfortunately not improved, and I still cannot get anything done (including posting Reddit updates) unless they are sleeping.  But, that’s life.  My CCIE will have to wait until the kids get older.  

TL;DR: Got a new job that cut my commute by 90%, gave me a good salary bump, and reduced the work stressload. Waiting until the kids are older before pursuing my CCIE+S.

Full Report: https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-359134A1.pdf

In summary:

> In the early morning of December 27, 2018, a switching module in CenturyLink’s Denver, Colorado node spontaneously generated four malformed management packets. Malformed packets are packets that, while not rare, are not typically generated on a network and are usually discarded immediately due to characteristics that indicate that the packets are invalid. In this instance, the malformed packets included fragments of valid network management packets that are typically generated. 
>
> Each malformed packet shared four attributes that contributed to the outage:  
>  1) a broadcast destination address, meaning that the packet was directed to be sent to all connected devices;  
>  2) a valid header and valid checksum;  
>  3) no expiration time, meaning that the packet would not be dropped for being created too long ago; and  
>  4) a size larger than 64 bytes. CenturyLink and Infinera state that, despite an internal investigation, they do not know how or why the malformed packets were generated 
>
> Due to the packets’ broadcast destination address, the malformed network management packets were delivered to all connected nodes. Consequently, each subsequent node receiving the packet retransmitted the packet to all its connected nodes, including the node where the malformed packets originated. Each connected node continued to retransmit the malformed packets across the proprietary management channel to each node with which it connected because the packets appeared valid and did not have an expiration time. This process repeated indefinitely. 
>
> The exponentially increasing transmittal of malformed packets resulted in a never-ending feedback loop that consumed processing power in the affected nodes, which in turn disrupted the ability of the nodes to maintain internal synchronization. Specifically, instructions to output line modules would lose synchronization when instructions were sent to a pair of line modules, but only one line module actually received the message. Without this internal synchronization, the nodes’ capacity to route and transmit data failed. As these nodes failed, the result was multiple outages across CenturyLink’s network.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/cszp02/summary_of_centurylinks_december_27_2018_outage/,"Summary of CenturyLink's December 27, 2018 outage.",,201,117,0.97

6srpbu,networking,1502349195.0,"A little under two years ago I wrote two posts about a guy named Jim, specifically [What do I do about Jim?](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3hn4od/what_do_i_do_about_jim/) and [[Update] What I did about Jim](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3kcjts/update_what_i_did_about_jim/).

I had to delete both posts and my account because I had a few close calls with the real Jim figuring out that he was the subject of what I wrote. The long story made short was that I had a coworker (not actually named Jim) who was the embodiment of someone who shouldn't be involved IT. Jim was resistant to change, he thought that the paradigms of the 1990s were the pinnacle of IT, and that basic networking practices like VLANs and STP were of the devil and unnecessary. Jim was also incredibly hostile to the point where I was being thrown under the bus daily, management and upper management didn't want to do anything about it, and I eventually decided that I needed to leave.

I've always wanted to bring a conclusion to the story. This community really helped me through a rough patch, and the least I can do is bring closure to how the story ends.

The problem is until now the Jim story has had a very shit ending, and I've wanted to end this on a high note.

Well, I've got a throwaway and an ending, so here it goes.

The industry I worked in took a sharp nose dive and I got laid off before I could find a better job. My boss's boss who wanted to fire Jim and Jim's boss for their incompetence, also got laid off. My boss was laid off a few months after I was let go. In fact out of our entire department only Jim remains.

I got lucky finding a new job before my savings ran out, but there were harsh lessons in the process.

I've always believed that networking is one of the safe disciplines in IT. I believed that if you get let go or have to leave, there are recruiters banging down the door to hire you. While may be true elsewhere, I learned that networking jobs in medium sized towns that are dependent on a small number of industries are hard to come by when those industries are suffering. Turns out if none of the local companies aren't making money, they don't want to hire extra networking folks.

I've never really had the money for certifications either, so getting recruiters interested in me was hard. There were a ton of positions that I applied to that didn't hire me because even though I had a decent level of knowledge and work history behind me, I didn't have that one certification they needed to get past HR. As much as I've shit on ITIL as a framework over the years, turns out ITIL got the last laugh when three decent positions declined me because they had candidates with their ITIL Foundations tickets and I didn't.

I eventually had to pack my bags and move about 200 miles away from where I lived to find another job even remotely in my field.

In the mean time, I secretly felt like Marvin the Martian, hoping for the earth shattering kaboom, the frantic phone call from Jim pleading for my assistance with an issue that he couldn't fix because he didn't know how. Jim would have to admit that I was the better admin, that the company had made a mistake in letting me go, and I was going to get my sweet justice in the form of a $250/hr consulting rate and bragging rights for all eternity. It was childish and stupid, and as bad of a person as this makes me, I was looking forward to the day Jim burned.

That day hasn't come.

I hoisted myself with my own petard. I'll be honest: When I built most of the network I was at a stage where I could do basic configurations and get things up and running, but if you'd ask me why STP decided that port was the root, I probably would have shrugged and said ""magic algorithms"". All I knew was that it stopped my network from having loops. So I tried to make up for my lack of knowledge by making comprehensive documentation and keeping my designs as simple to maintain as possible.

Turns out that really simple designs and tons of documentation make the networks really easy to maintain. I've talked to Jim, and Jim is in a position where he can't expand the network. He doesn't know how to do things like make new VLANs talk to each other or change what VLAN a port is assigned to, or how to how to get those VLANs on one router to talk to other VLANs on another router. It's to the point that when they decided to build a new office, he had to build it ""the old way"" (read: without VLANs, managed switches, or even a proper firewall between the site and the internet) because that's all he knew how.

Yet, at the end of the day, the printer still prints, the computers can still surf the web, and it didn't cost as much as ""that old bastard network admin wanted, with his $1000 switches and $1500 firewalls!"", and the company is happy.

With the additional staff burden removed from the budget he now has room to hire consultants when he runs into something he can't fix or do. I've come to understand that he says every flaw (even flaws that existed before I got to the company) were my fault and if something does break, it'll probably be ""old guys poor design that did it"". From the people I still know at the company, the story to management is, ""old guy didn't know what he was doing when he made all of these changes, I was right all along, STP is the root of all evil, VLANs are unnecessary, we've only ever had a few viruses on our unpatched Windows XP machines, please pay my consultancy bill to fix this one issue"". Rinse and repeat.

As petty as I was for wanting something to break - I don't think that'll ever happen.

So the story is pretty depressing so far.

But it does have one small light at the end of the tunnel. My new job is fucking awesome. It sucked ass moving, but I'm in a good place now.

I have a manager who has a networking background. I get mentored when I don't understand something.

I get budget not only to fix things when they break, but to stop them from breaking to begin with. Not only do we have VLANs, but everyone on my team supports the idea of VLANs. VLANs aren't evil, they are our friends. I don't have to spend hours writing CYA emails whenever the network goes down because the power at the site has been out for a day and the battery's run out. I don't have to spend hours defending basic changes like, ""we put a printer on Gi 1/0/32, so I'm going to change that port to be on the printer VLAN instead of the normal data VLAN"" and writing up huge change control documents to prove that the change I'm proposing isn't going to suddenly cause the network to implode.

And you know what? I've got a boss and a team that embraces change too. I've always found Docker, OpenStack, Vagrant, etc, interesting. But when I worked in an environment where the mere idea of anything that wasn't VMWare or Microsoft being a complete dumpster fire, I was never going to touch those. Now my boss tells me to take time to look into them, to make demo environments, and I get to show the team what I've learned and why they're valuable tools. And when I've showed that they're useful, I get approval to actually implement them.

I'm even getting to write scripts in Python to automate the boring parts of my job, and I have coworkers who understand what the scripts I wrote do! And they can improve on my scripts! Things aren't perfect, but compared to my old job I live in god damn candy land.

And I'm learning. Now that I'm not spending every waking fucking moment trying to justify why the mere presence of STP isn't the root of all of our problems, and every other waking moment living out [this Dilbert comic](http://dilbert.com/strip/2013-04-07), I actually have time to study. I'm actually getting paid a decent wage, which means I can actually go out and get the certifications I've always wanted to prove that I know what I say I know.

**tl;dr**: Got laid off, had to move, didn't get any of the sweet ""fuck you consultancy"" money, network hasn't broken causing Jim a headache, I've probably gotten shit at my old company on more times than I'll ever know, Jim's still gainfully employed and probably won't ever have any motivation to move or have anyone recognize the lack of effort he's put into his craft.

a5pvnj,networking,1544673402.0,"I took down an entire building. (yay)

I am working as a wireless netadmin in higher ed. We are currently running an Aruba 6.x environment and I am currently building out an 8.x environment side by side. My new controllers are on our production subnet (first mistake I guess but I don't have a full test environment). So it was already a busy day, I spent the majority of my day with TAC trying to get rid of an inherited VLAN on my controllers which forced almost an entire rebuild of the environment in order to remove it.  My boss left early to get to a doctor's appointment and it was nearing the end of the day.  I figured I could probably leave right at 5, get home at a nice time and enjoy my night. So I'm finishing rebuilding the environment by adding my controllers back to the cluster and because of our use of CoA, I needed to add two more VIPs for each member in the cluster. I have a dedicated subnet for this, but I decided because I was getting incorrect information into RADIUS that I would try using the same subnet as my controllers for it...just as a test.

So my controllers are on x.x.x.3 and x.x.x.4 with its VIP on .2. I figured I would just use .5 and .6 for the other two addresses to test. I ping the addresses, nothing responds so I think I'm good to go (third mistake). I add two more SVIs on the controllers with .5 and .6 and give it a whirl. Same issue with RADIUS so I pack up my stuff and get ready to leave.

...Then I get an e-mail from Airwave.

Triple digit number of APs reported as down.

What?

I log into the router, gateway is up. I do a source ping to the controllers from the gateway, all good. I ping some of the APs. Nothing. I log into the production controller, zero APs listed. I can't remember exactly what I said, but I think it was ""Oh darn!"" or something like that. I log into the master and I'm greeted with pages of APs ""upgrading.""  Oh god. I look to my AOS8 controller and lo and behold, there they are.

What is going on?!

All the APs are now terminating to my test setup. I didn't change a profile, I didn't touch an lms-ip, what could possibly be going on? I check the provisioning profile and it's pointing to the master with the TFTP IP pointing to the production controller, all good there. I dig down into the system profile and I find it. The LMS-IP (in Aruba land, that's where the APs terminate their traffic) is set to .5 even though that is not used by any controller. Well, at least not until I decided to make .5 an active interface. This was before my time, but our procedure is to boot all APs to the master and then provision them to the local controller.

So I immediately shut down the ports on my 8.x controllers and the APs downgrade and reattach themselves to the production controllers.

All in all, about 20 minutes downtime but lucky for me, no tickets generated.

Though they had done this in previous sessions, they were entering an additional command to ""open a door."" A challenge phrase would appear and, once successfully answered, the CLI would turn into a Linux shell. This gave them access to the underlying Linux system **as root**.

I guess the rep began to just copy-paste the commands into the shell a little while into our session — probably due to how tedious it was. At one point they didn't get into the right configuration level, causing the security phrase to be exposed as some commands failed to execute.

Are you ready for it?

The password is:

# `pazzword`

Yup. That's it.

Did I also mention that this works for both their network equipment _and_ enterprise management server software?

_____

## So what?

### First and foremost, that's really terrible security

That password is really easy to brute-force/guess. Who in the hell approved that?!

The password is, of course, hard-coded into the firmware and it's not obfuscated. While servicing one of our units, I pulled out the USB and cloned it. I got curious and disassembled one of the files. Sure enough, [the command is visible](http://imgur.com/R3SNt17) and the [""pazzword"" can be found in the strings](http://imgur.com/hvFFFrs).

### Second, it gives you **root** access to the underlying system

BusyBox commands and . . . oh, `/usr/etc/sshd_config`! We can enable passwordless login as root (which works) or increase the verbosity to see key exchanges. Use your imagination. 

### Third, this can be setup and accessed within the AOS

This isn't some zero-day exploit, I know. You'd have to have access to the equipment for this to make much of a difference. For an employee with access, it doesn't require taking the unit offline. Also, there is at least one exploit from other parts of the AOS that can give you `config` privileges which haven't been patched over the years. I'd be wary of using cloud management too . . .

#### Why is it an issue, you may ask?

1. If the boot argument is set, _any account that can enter global configuration mode_ can open this door
2. If the boot argument is not set, anyone with access to the `boot-env` command can set it and then open this door
3. If the boot argument is not set and the user can't edit the `boot-env`, but they have access to the bootloader and global configuration mode, they can modify the `bootargs` value there and save it. You'll notice a device rebooting in the logs or going offline in your monitoring system for a short period, but if you have some spare units tucked away . . . 

1 & 2 do not require rebooting the device. Unless you actively monitor command authentication, you won't notice much. Commands entered in the Linux shell aren't logged (obviously). The second one requires read-write privileges, so you'll see the boot environment being saved.

### How can you access the door?

It's simple! You need `CLIOPTS=b` in the `bootargs` variable

#### To set the `bootargs`:

    # config
    (config)# boot-env
    (config-env)# edit bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root 	=/dev/ram rw quiet CLIOPTS=b
    (config-env)# save ! we *must* save within the boot-env as it's separate from the system config!

#### To finally access it:

    # config
    (config)# o

A challenge then pops up:

`Opendoor?`

Enter in `pazzword` and you're good to go.

_____

## EDIT #1

Some of you are rightfully questioning this since it requires access to the CLI and global configuration mode. It may not seem much of a ""backdoor"" if you have to get in from the front.

Here's the thing: you don't have to.

Each device adds an extra user to the system who can log in.

    # whoami
    XR*********** ! This is the serial number of the device

    # groups
    root

    # cat /etc/passwd
    XR***********:x:0:0::/:/bin/xap_cli
    exampleadmin:x:0:0::/:/bin/xap_cli
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
    nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/home:/bin/sh
    sshd:x:100:101::/home/sshd:/bin/sh

    # cat /etc/shadow
    XR***********:$1$********$*******************************:0:99999:7:::
    exampleadmin:$1$********$*******************************:0:99999:7:::
    root:!:14020:0:99999:7:::
    nobody:*:13991:0:99999:7:::
    sshd:*:14020:0:99999:7:::

Notice that the user (read: device serial number) is active and can be logged in via SSH. They have root privileges. The question I'd like to ask is: what is the password? If it's static or is based on an algorithm that doesn't use randomization, then all you need is the serial number to get in.

My parents claimed they were being sent to an Amazon.com Phishing site. I checked the DNS setting on their computer, it was fine. Having setup their router (an ASUS RT-N56U) with a strong password for remote admin, I didn't expect DNS to be compromised at that level, but low and behold it was.  It was explicitly set to an unknown IP address.

On a whim, I entered the IP into my browser and what do you know, an apache webserver was running with directory indexing enabled. One folder, contained the following files: 

* asus.txt
* asusgood.txt
* ddwrt.txt
* ddwrtgood.txt
* netgear.txt
* netgearbad.txt
* netgeargood.txt


Each of these text files contained hundreds, some thousands of entries with an IP address, remote admin port, username and password.

What surprised me is that the passwords didn't seem brute force or dictionary friendly.

* w10178311
* ju1i3&nit@2014
* vX487bXWkxgu
* qwsaQS!@WSsffsew

28o8xi,networking,1403298362.0,"  While working to deploy VoIP to a new site this week we ran into one of the most uniquely insane bugs I've ever seen. The site consists of a bunch of 8945 phones with an SRST router backing up the call manager. Part of the deployment called for the ability to have an intercom style paging system for the phones at the site. 

  For this we are using Synapps-Announce to act as the intercom system, unfortunately for some reason whenever we tried to page every phone in the building would lock up every phone in the building requiring the phones to be power cycled. This is a bit of a deal breaker, so with the help of a 3x CCIE we started trying to troubleshoot. 

  Now the obvious place to start is to span the PC port on the phone and wireshark the data coming to the phone as it's crashing, but when we brought one of the phones back to the office and tried to page it the page worked. Now this is really strange because the network between the sites is entirely layer two, with nothing that could be changing between the sites. 

  Finally we took the phone back to the site and sure enough trying to page it crashed it on cue. We struggled to try to find a solution for hours until we tried to page the phone while at the remote site using the phone at our main office. This worked! This however lead to the question of what was different. Following this we moved the phone line that was working back at the office to one of the phones at the remote location. This too worked. This seemed to be narrowing down even further, in excitement we start comparing the two lines but there is only one thing different between the two lines, that being the name in the caller ID field.

  In a desperate Hail Mary we change the caller ID on the non functioning line to match the caller ID of the functioning line. To our complete and utter shock, it worked! At this point we start messing with the caller ID, changing the name around to see if we can find the exact failure point. Two hours later this is the conclusion we find





The phones crash if and ONLY if either the first or second letter of the second word of the caller ID name is a lower case letter 'n'  if we named it 'john_nancy' the page goes through, but if we named it 'john nancy' the page fails and crashes the phone; even naming it 'John Nancy' worked just fine.

  The best part was getting the Synapps support tech from the intercom software on the phone to test the situation on his lab in the office and hearing ""Oh holy shit! It crashed"" after telling us it was probably an issue with our phone set up.

Latest frustration is trying to get Prisma integrated into our environment; we're kinda hybrid with some servers on-prem and some on our AWS VPC.  Remote users need to access both.  Prisma says it supports service connections to AWS, and that it supports BGP, should be great right?

Not so fast.  Prisma doesn't support any kind of BGP Route filtering, or metric tuning, path prepend, anything that you'd actually expect for a service that claims to support BGP. You have to either send ALL of the routes in your Prisma route table to AWS, or nothing. Their excuse is to just do static routing on the other side . . . but AWS doesn't support static routes to individual connections (only to the Virtual Gateway).

So now I'm in this situation of Prisma saying “We don’t support BGP route filtering, use static routes” and AWS saying “We don’t support static routes, use BGP route filtering”.

... and i knew i had to add my ""2 cents"" since we are seeing lot of similarities (and not only that)

One funny thing - when first ""FP rant"" was released, one of the TACs contacted me directly asking if that's me :)

&#x200B;

Well, let's start

To introduce myself, i'm network engineer currently working mostly with FP technology (FMC, FTD, FXOS etc.). Experienced with other NGFW/traditional enterprise vendors and products such as:

Checkpoint - both Splat/Gaia sensors, Provider-1, Security management

FortiNet - FortiGate sensors, FortiAnalyzer

Juniper - Netscreen sensors, NSM

In our case, we are talking about scalable dynamic data center / telco environment with huge amount of the changes within the platform itself.

&#x200B;

What are we using

FMC4k appliances in HA for central management a database, some FP4k & FP9k appliances in logical FTD-HA as well as some 5512 ASA firewalls.

No virtual devices in place (not that's making any difference)

We started with 6.1.x version and now we are having three different environments running 6.2.3.x, 6.3.x and some others.

Honestly, it does not make that much of a difference speaking of SW version since there's minimal progress overall and it's all because of the - pardon my French - most idiotic FW design i ever seen in my life!!!

&#x200B;

# DESIGN, DESIGN, DESIGN!!!

This is a root cause of all evil and because of the design decisions made here, i was able to successfully develop a    tourette syndrome after all those years working with the product.

I'm not quite sure what decisions were made during development, but if you think that using legacy ASA code along with FTD services without re-design is way to go, i can assure you that it's not .

This product has to be redesigned,  otherwise i see no option how this product can be even close to enterprise NGFW solutions of other vendors.

Well, to rephrase - you can try, but we already know the results, and man ... what a disaster it is

&#x200B;

For sensor,  you have so cold LINA engine which is nothing else but legacy ASA code (ACL filter) with magical FTD services on top of it and rabbitmq messaging between those. Cooked as unified FTD image.

Just imagine it as VM running on top of hypervisor provided by FXOS.

Speaking of VM on FXOS, new 6.3.0 version is finally allowing to run multiple FTD instances. You can share resources, interfaces and so on. Even routing between instances is possible.

I haven't had time to test this fully yet, but again - marketing slide is one thing, real experience is something different. From design perspective, each and every FTD is consuming 2 CPU resource for management plane. Those cannot be shared. Imagine running 12 FTD instances on top of FXOS. This is resulting in 24 CPU cores utilization only for management plane. Not possible to allocate those for data plane or share among instances. What a waste.

&#x200B;

Usability is just a pain as well - you have different set of commands on each layer, some of those are not even ported correctly or not showing same results!

Basic troubleshooting commands such as ""capture"" are not the same on both LINA/FTD.

It's even worse on latest 6.3.0 version if compared to  6.2.3.x

Forget also about ""grep"" feature for ""show route"" in 6.3.0 FTD, it's gone. Why? Don't ask me ...

Sure, you can still ""workaround"" some of these by switching between layers to get some results. You just need to develop a huge sense of humor and same level of understanding and forgiveness (luckily, i learned that already as a married man)

Then you have OPS perspective. Since beginning, we are unable to handover this technology to operation. This is causing overhead for me as network engineer and for my employer as well (believe me, i have better things to do than creating cases and trying to figure out how to solve and address daily issues)

&#x200B;

FMC is not any better. First surprise is slowness. Second surprise is efficiency.

It run 2 fragile databases and we were able to corrupt both by non-graceful shutdown.

Amount of limitations is also alarming, it's not allowing you to route management using anything else but default route for IPv6, traffic logs can be shown but it's nightmare to export them (forget about more than 400k lines). Deployment times are joke (regardless what change is performed, you are wasting time cause FMC has to download whole FTD config and deploy changes back + validate on FTD/ASA).

More in section below

# LIFE WITH FIREPOWER - EXPECTATIONS vs REALITY

It's quite challenging. As mentioned above, we consider design as main issue and almost every issue is caused by that fact.

&#x200B;

FTD/FMC

When we first started, i couldn't understand how there can be a product on the market with no backup/restore functionality. Honestly, i still don't understand.

When reported, it has been even marked as ""feature request"" and not a bug. Yes, you read that correctly. To have backup/restore possibility for NGFW enterprise product, you need to file a feature request yourself. At the end, we manage to have it re-categorize as a bug but it caused a lot of pain. And sure, because of the design (sftunnel FMC to FTD) it's not even possible to restore if the device is removed from FMC. Forget it, it's gone. No ETA for fix! (6.4 affected as well)

Sure, you can use API's for that and we are doing so, but until 6.2.3.x those were useless! It's getting better tho.

But still, if we want to create our own backup/restore using APIs, due to our policy and design construct, it's taking ages (hours) to finish device configuration (FTD-HA - interface/zone/routing perspective)

Even, worth to mention - try to keep FTD and FMC version to be the same. We have experienced some APIs inconsistency in versions are not the same (you won't find this in guideline).

Speaking of FMC, this whole ""FTD to FMC"" procedure is 100% brainless. You need to remove FTD from FMC because of some issues? Sure, you can do so, but FMC will not preserve any configuration related to HA (forget about monitoring interfaces, secondary IPs and so), any routing/routing related configuration or bond of logical zones with interfaces. If your policy package is constructed in such way (as zone based FW) you will experience an outage - you have no chance to interrupt this action and FMC will just push configuration ""as is"".

Funny is that for version 6.2.0.x this has not been even mentioned in the guideline. We performed re-registration of FTD due to some issues and we caused an outage. Assigned TAC found reference since bug was in database already. I still remember - this ""routing information removal"" bug was having priority 6 - enhancement that time! (maybe it still has same prio, haven't checked that for long time).

Another critical bug affecting FMC-HA deployment resulted in deletion of ""random"" ACL lines from the devices to which configuration was deployed. It literally removed couple of lines causing an outage.

In 2018/2019 you would expect full IPv6 support as well. Reality is bit different. Version 6.3.0 is the first release supporting object search for IPv6 in FMC. Until now, FMC was unable to parse/handle "":"" and there were no results. You cannot even tract objects within policy package (""where used"" is not there yet).

Because of this and all other limitations of FMC, we are running 3rd party database with some excel sheets to backup and to search efficiently. I'm not even mentioning amount of the cases raised for FMC for past 2 years for all the limitations and missing features of the product.

FMC is unable to do the delta comparison, dry run, lock the policy, revert saved changes, search efficiently, track objects, create reports for audit purposes (due to known limitations of the whole engine, there's 400 000 line limit hardcoded for traffic log/intrusion log report)

And it is slow. Sometimes you have to withdraw changes you made to policy package cause it's saving it for 5+ minutes and it' easier for you to start over.

And if you want to laugh a lot, try to implement static IPv6 route. You simply cannot! Why? Apparently, there's a good explanation for that but we have not received it. Maybe they did not see use case for that :)

Same applies for capture feature on FTD, prior to version 6.2.3.x you could not specify IPv6 address to the filter. As a workaround, you have to capture whole interface (with no port type filter, otherwise you will get IPv4 only) and grep or use 3rd party software to work with.

&#x200B;

Flexconfig feature to substitute missing or not implemented ASA-like commands is still in diapers. Prior to version 6.2.3 this even resulted in unsuccessful rollback in case you inserted set of commands with typos or with commands that were not taken by FTD fot whatever reason. Your configuration got wiped afterwards and FTD just crashed and went to the default state. Considering time of the deployment (8 mins for standard config and 19 for snort enabled platform) you can easily do the math. This has improved in 6.2.3 version but it's still fragile.

We experienced same for NAT.

Basically, if you are able to implement a change in FMC which is in direct conflict with FTD, FMC will try to deploy it, no matter what. This is resulting in rollback (and you should start praying to have a successful one).

&#x200B;

Policy package construct is also weird. FTD is using same construct as for ASA. If you are creating a rule which consists of 1 source IP, 1 destination IP and 1 port, you are ending up nicely with 1 ACL rule. This rule is then redistributed to FMC.

Modern NGFW rule-base construct is fully aware of nested groups, nested objects and zone. Because of this simple combinatoric, rule expansion is actually rising ""to infinity and beyond"". In our case, we are facing situation using NGFW zone based firewall without zones because of this limitation (or call it a design). And for sure, this is well described in the guideline so we just have to keep our heads down and work with it somehow. When same configuration was deployed to other vendor SOHO box that's using object based construct, it went through successfully without any expansion issues. Sure, competitors has some limitations as well, but in this case our ACL construct consumed all memory available and crashed.

&#x200B;

I almost forgot, if you are using the product, do me a favor. Try to ping any routed unreachable host with ping count of 2000 as an example or execute a trace route towards that IP address. Share the results :)

&#x200B;

# SNORT ALMIGHTY

For Cisco, to buy Sourcefire was definitely a right move, as IPS/IDS this device works well for the current and former Sourcefire customers.

While trying to develop a strategy, we wanted to run some IDS-like solution first to see how many false positives are we getting and what's the impact on system resources. What we did was the scan of the platform using built-in Nmap solution, comparison with our 3rd party scanner and creating some host profiles.

First, Nmap installed on FMC is version 6.01 from 2012 is outdated (you can even easily check vulnerabilities for such version). Seems vendor is OK with it since this is a version installed on 6.3.0 version

Second, network discovery profiles are missing for whole variety of enterprise OS versions. Latest VBD database is also outdated. Recommendations are then not accurate and when we tried to feed FMC using tailored script and changed the value for OS, recommendations were still the same. Why would you even use recommendations if you cannot rely on it? How many false positives could we expect then?

Another open topic is a granularity of intrusion policies, or in other words - how many policies should/could we implement. Sure, there's no specific answer to that and it all just depends. Out of the record, customer are usually using single digit number of policies (at least per rumors we've heard)

&#x200B;

I recommend you to check CCO live slides if you have an access to, there are full of recommendations, best practices and so on. Unfortunately, this is not giving us the answers for Nmap & discovery profile issues we are having.

&#x200B;

# UPGRADE, TEST, REPEAT

Like every other vendor, Cisco is providing major/minor/patches releases on some agreed basis. This is nice. Theoretically speaking of course.If i would get a penny for every promise regarding stability, usability etc. i could quit my job, move to some paradise island and drink mojitos all day long.

We are taking every single possibility to move this product further, we have two testing platforms for releases that are installed before released to our production environment and i'm getting tired of it.

Most of critical topics (and man, we have some!) were supposed to be targeted on version 6.2.3. Cisco committed to deliver stability. Stability that should help us to at least get rid of all inconsistencies while deploying or changing configuration. Amount of the TAC cases raised right after the upgrade is in direct conflict with this statement. Nothing has changed!

And version 6.3.0 is not any magical as well. They added backup/restore for FTD which is quite limited, in case your device is removed from FMC, you cannot restore it anyhow. End of story.

We don't mind the upgrades, we are even happy to see that there's a time line for major/minor releases in place and if the patch is necessary to be provided, it is provided mostly ad-hoc.

Unfortunately, if the design will not change we can do upgrades indefinitely. It simply doesn't work for us.

&#x200B;

Long story short: working with this technology in dynamic environment is resulting in huge amount of cases, bugs, troubleshooting requests with no real progress. This is not something i made up, this is pure engineer/end user experience.

I personally feel like a beta tester of the product

&#x200B;

# WHAT ABOUT VENDOR?

TAC experience is great, these folks are doing their best to help us and address all issues we are having with the product. Advanced FP team is trying to solve or at least advise how to avoid such issues for the future.

On the other hand, the BU is for us nothing but a black box. We have very limited visibility once bugs/feature requests are raised.

I'm not in the position to judge, but if i'm waiting almost 2 years for critical design related bugs to be addressed, there has to be something wrong. Not even mentioning all feature requests we raised. You can try to guess what's the progress there ...

&#x200B;

I really want to be surprised but i have already lost most of the patience.

&#x200B;

# CONCLUSION

If you are asking who should go and buy this product, it's hard to say.

If you are in strong partnership with Cisco or if you are just replacing old ASA firewalls with new Firepowers, it might go bit better for you than for us. If your are not doing lot of intrusive/design or conceptual changes, you might even like the product. It is well suited for ""set and forget"" deployments or i see nice implementation for voice&video environments where only Cisco technology is used.

On the other hand, if you do not requite centralized management, i would stick with ASA. Maybe CDO (Cisco Defense Orchestrator) might be an answer for you, but we did not test it since our deployment requires ""on-prem"" solution and CDO is unable to provide that.

I believe that Cisco is pushing here, APIs are also improved and on version 6.3 it seems to be more or less stable.

&#x200B;

If your environment is dynamic, and/or you have no preferred NGFW vendor for now and Firepower was in your scope as well, my recommendation is to avoid it. It's not worth at the moment and i believe that it will not be worth the money until it's completely redesigned to at least get close to other vendors.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I can only say the same as user laclobunu 6 months ago. Don't buy it, it's not worth your time, energy, mental health and money.

ahfp0n,networking,1547849712.0,"Monday, I'm going to be asked to explain to 25 other network engineers, including 6 or 7 other senior engineers, why it is bad to create a cluster across data centers, as opposed to have a cluster at each DC and failover between.  And if I cannot sufficiently explain why, then ""the way it's always been"" will take precedence over our 99.999% service availability SLA.

&#x200B;

I really wish I could say that I'm joking.  But I'm not.  I'm sitting here right now, just... Stunned.  I feel like I'm being asked to explain why it's painful to cut off your left foot with a hack saw.  All I can think of is, ""because it hurts like hell!""

&#x200B;

One of the senior engineers is deploying a firewall cluster to upgrade his aging firewalls.  For years, the way we've always done it has been to buy two firewalls (or storage nodes, or VPN termination points, or anchor controllers, etc etc etc) and put one at each of our data centers in an active-active or active-hot-standby type of design.  Stretch those VLANs and call it a day.  No, we do not bother reading vendor best practice design documents.  When someone points out that such documents generally discourage this type of design, it is literally ignored.  I gave up trying to intervene many years ago, but have recently been put in a position where the expectation is that I'm to intervene and to *not* give up.

&#x200B;

What would you say in this situation?  Any links to hard facts that I could maybe provide?  I can't really give links and say ""Go read this"" because it will be ignored.  But if I can throw out some facts and possibly even specific examples, I may have a chance.

scusim,networking,1643163851.0,"**An IDS/NGFW without visibility into the traffic (acting as a non-decrypting proxy or decrypting TLS) is not worth the cost if you have a limited budget**. DoH, DoT, DGA, and Domain Fronting make them almost obsolete. Also abuse of cloud platforms but that's not their fault.

Assumption: This is definitely regarding corporate networks and specifically detecting threats within them.

But what about the SNI header? TLS 1.3 encrypts it. Good luck. That's the basis for a lot of encryption analysis. You have to be in-line and decrypting for that. edit: esni is mostly dead, cloudflare is moving to ech. 

What about the size of the payload and response? You can randomly pad that. Even a skidde can pull that off. 

But what about monitoring DNS traffic? DoT and DoH can both use TLS 1.3 and obscure any visibility. Edit: You can monitor current DoH/DoT endpoints, but if there are endpoints you don't know about, you're blind to that.

But what about making calls to the bad IP address to determine what it is? All you need to do is require a specific HTTP header or something similar to return a response, else present a blank page. Good luck figuring it out NGFW/IDS without insight into the payload.

But what about monitoring bad IP addresses? It's easy for ransomware operators to shift IPs and Domains. See the SANS [pyramid of pain.](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) Also these [Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/the-rise-of-bulletproof-residential-networks/) articles on Bulletproof malware operators and platforms. Also see most IOCs from Talos where Domains tend to be referenced first as they're better but still not amazing.

I've been on 8 incidents  last year. Most of them were spear phishing campaigns using DGA (Domain Generating Algorithms), Newly registered domains, fronted domains, or abuse of cloud platforms (looking at you AWS and Oracle Cloud Platform, but also One drive, Google Drive etc).

Buy an EDR instead if you have to choose one. Preferably Crowdstrike, but Defender is good too. Turn off local admin, macros, and detachable USB and you'll be better off than most.

tl:dr: I don't give a fuck what the SEs at Cisco, Fortinet or Palo says (But Palo has pretty good threat intel imo). Act as a proxy, decrypt or it isn't really worth the effort. You're better off with just a Layer 4 Firewall/NAT Gateway and saving some $$$. Current CCIE and CISSP former VAR engineer. Tired of watching customers waste coin on stuff that won't help them.

Edit: I would like people to focus on the context of using an IDS/IPS/NGFW as a control to detect and prevent bad behavior. Defense in depth is important. I'm not saying it isn't.

We've taken on the laughably open-ended network automation ""project"" at my workplace. It's become obvious that there isn't a single automation solution that can automate more than one platform.

Cisco has there thing, F5 has an API, Palo Alto has its management platform that exposes an API, etc., etc.

We've looked and ansible, salt, chef, all the usual suspects. Each has its own pluses and minuses, but all of them will require so much customization that we'll just end up being full-time developers.

Redditor: ""But those are just frameworks""

Me: Yup!

That's the issue. Napalm, netconf, yang, etc. have all been promising the ability to abstract the config into a parsable config that can be handed off something else to implement the change.

Sounds great, right? A vendor agnostic config that creates VLAN 123 on everything from your edge devices to your access layer switches, and everything in between.

The problem is that as soon as you have more than one vendor (or 12+) in play you have to create a half step that tweaks the config for this vendor's flavor of netconf, or API, or ssh wrapper.

## Introduction

If you are a Network Engineer interested in automation, you may have already heard about **Paramiko**. As per the official documentation, paramiko is the Python implementation of the **SSH** protocol. When wielding this library effectively, you gain the ability to communicate with your remote devices through your scripts. And as you might imagine, doing this programmatically has several advantages, including but not limited to...

&nbsp;

*Automation*! *Scripting*! *SDN*! *Machine Learning*! *Buzzwords*!

&nbsp;

...or so I’d love to say. Unfortunately, programming with paramiko can be ***messy***. In fact, getting paramiko to even *work* proves to be a sizeable challenge. An eager learner can easily get discouraged. And that’s a problem. Thankfully, libraries like Kirk Byers' **Netmiko** exist to eliminate most if not all that initial frustration. Netmiko, as the name may imply, is an abstraction of paramiko, and provides a reliable framework for talking to network related devices remotely. This is the most popular first option for automating as a Network Engineer, and for good reason.

&nbsp;

Despite all that I’ve said, there is merit to learning about and programming with paramiko directly. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel necessarily, but understanding why Paramiko behaves the way it does will lead to a better understanding of SSH programming in general. This translates to direct improvement to your skill as a programmer and in automation. If that sounds good to you, let’s get started!

##The Importance Of Flags
Let’s imagine for a second that you need to run two commands on an IOS device - “*show ip interface brief*” and “*show interface status*”. If you want to succeed in running these two commands, first you need to wait until one command completes, before running the other. That sounds like common sense, right?

&nbsp;

Believe it or not, we take this basic ability of ours for granted. In the world of programming, your script is not smart enough to determine on its own if a command has completed. There’s a real possibility that your script will send the next command too early!

&nbsp;

In order to combat this inadequacy, programmers have come up with the concept of flags. Flags are simply little *FYIs* from the other end stating that a command has completed successfully or not. In an ideal scenario, our scripts can simply take advantage of these built in flags.

&nbsp;

**Fig.1** - *Ideal Scenario*

https://i.imgur.com/tx9dG3C.png

&nbsp;

Now, if you go into paramiko believing you can do the above, keep dreaming! Most network routers and switches were not built in mind for automation. The ability to send more than one command over in a single SSH session by relying on flags is more or less an impossibility.

&nbsp;

If we cannot take advantage of flags, a common ingredient in normal SSH programming, we need to develop a different approach to the problem. Fortunately, there’s two very popular solutions to this issue.

## Approach #1: The Timer Delay Method
The timer delay method is straightforward and easy to understand - simply invoke a delay between each command. Let’s bring back our scenario, but instead of relying on flags, we decide to design our solution around delay. To start, we set up the timer with a delay of 5 seconds.

&nbsp;

**Fig.2** - *The Timer Delay Scenario*

https://i.imgur.com/XifD6Yo.png

&nbsp;

When Netmiko was originally being developed by Kirk Byers, he used this method to control sending commands over to network devices. The delay approach works great when it does work, but there’s two major flaws you need to understand before deciding whether you want to implement it or not.

&nbsp;

First, there’s going to be an issue when a command takes longer than five seconds to run. Let’s say for whatever reason, at the time of running your script, your device took an additional few seconds to run the command. Instead of completing within five seconds, it took the device six seconds. As you’d expect, the second command ends up failing.

&nbsp;

Of course, you can keep introducing longer delays to prevent these issues, but that brings us to our second major problem. The need for speed. If you want your scripts to complete in a reasonable amount of time, introducing a lot of delay will hamper that ability. For instance, 100 commands, 10 switches, and 5 seconds delay will introduce a total of 83 minutes of pure delay!

&nbsp;

So what do we do to combat these pretty severe issues?

## Approach #2: The Expect Trailing Method
The expect trailing method is the idea of waiting for the correct output from the switch before running the next command. Let’s say for instance, you expect to see the “HOSTNAME#” on the prompt after the command finishes running. You can use this expectation to design your solution.

&nbsp;

**Fig.3** - *The Expect Trailing Scenario*

https://i.imgur.com/OzZbKfD.png

&nbsp;

With this method, you can build your entire solution to cope with any normal issues. For example, if you see “*HOSTNAME>*” instead of “*HOSTNAME#*”, you can build your logic so that it sends the ***enable*** command first. The strength of your connectivity to devices is primarily reliant on your ability to code and come up with strong logic to deal with any edge cases.

&nbsp;

Now, you might be curious to know what the downsides are to this solution. At a glance, this is equally as powerful as the flag method, there’s no unnecessary delay, and it seems reliable. The only real issue is that this seems to require more coding and logic. That’s where you’d, unfortunately, be wrong.

&nbsp;

When SSH programming, you read data from the socket directly. This data comes in bytes, so as a Python programmer, you’d need to convert it over to unicode first before interpreting the data. You also have to keep reading from the socket to see if you received any new information from the device, so that you can react to a trailing prompt. So far so good, but as with any data that comes in from the socket, you can get corrupted data. For instance, the longer the expected trailing prompt of yours, the higher the chance of failure. Although your scripts may react exactly the same way 95% of the time, the other 5% of the time they will fail!

&nbsp;

The problem stems from the fact that there’s a two way interaction going on in this method. If you noticed, the arrow in the middle of the figure is two way. When there’s a back and forth interaction with a remote device, you introduce a huge variable into play. Your expectation that the device will react the same each and every time can easily be proven wrong!

&nbsp;

**Fig.4** - *Socket Reading*

https://i.imgur.com/qeRMBQh.png

&nbsp;

There are ways to improve the success rate. With enough tweaking and handling, you can reasonably improve success rate to 99%. But there’s no conceivable way to bump that up to 100%. If you were curious, Netmiko’s current system relies on the second approach, with a few minor timer delays built into Netmiko’s core script for reliability.

##Final Thoughts
Programming with paramiko directly isn’t easy, but understanding why paramiko fails the way it does will give you a better understanding of SSH programming in general. Netmiko has already been designed to keep these issues in mind, so you generally don’t have to worry about it. But if you are ever in a scenario where you can’t use netmiko for whatever reason, it is possible to design your own custom solution.

&nbsp;

However, SSH programming is not a reliable way to automate at all, but it’s the best one we’ve got for probably another decade. Let’s hope API call automation becomes the norm by then!

&nbsp;

I plan to create these concept articles once a month, with an additional practical article to accompany it later that month. The practical articles will involve working code and simulated scenarios. 

&nbsp;

I’ve kept out quite a bit of details from this article, as it focuses on the concept and I did not want to overwhelm the readers. Please let me know if you have any feedback. You can reach me either through reddit or email (listed below). I will be keeping an archive of all my posts on my website as well if you want to check that out. There are no plans to monetize anything.

We were told at the beginning of the year that our SMARTNET isn't being renewed, and we're told this week we're going to be buying unmanaged D-Link switches to replace our C3750's and 4500 cores.

When I responded that we would need to re-ip everything to fit in one subnet/broadcast domain because unmanaged switches do not support vlans that was said to not be acceptable.

I had planned to collapse the wiring closets which were each a /24 with routed access to the core into a flat /21 network.  Now that idea is out the window... so now I'm thinking out of the box.  Do you think it will work to instead just change every hosts netmask so they all fall in the same subnet?  That way nothing changes IP, and everything can still talk to everything else via ARP.  At the same time I guess change every default gateway to point directly to our sonic wall.

The only thing I can think of is potential broadcast storms, so we'd be deploying a non looping tree topology with strictly one uplink per leaf node to the spine layer, which will be a single switch uplinked to our sonicwall.

Our server guys also offered to stand up a VM if we really need a router to run VyOS or something, which opens the door to all kinds of cool software defined options.

3fnbjd,networking,1438625898.0,"I found this Monday morning store to be particularly hilarious.

Backstory. I work for a top 5 largest school district. We have around 215 locations plus a large amount of alternate education locations. Years ago the decision was made that it was too expensive to run Fiber for every school and so we got bids and agreed with an ISP to get a local network using their fiber, for all of our schools. So every school is connected via this ISP, and VPN's through their network to get to our primary office and then goes through filtering before hitting the internet.

This monday morning, we noticed that one of our schools were down. We spoke with the onsite tech for that location, and he said that everything was up, green lights everywhere, powercycled, but we had no internet. We dispatched a field operator to the site, and then contacted the ISP after verifying that the issue was not on our end. We have a special customer care line and the Engineer there told us that there was a note that someone called in and asked for the service to be canceled and so it was disabled.

We are still investigating this to determine where it ends up, but as far as it seems, despite having a multiyear, multimillion dollar contract with them, someone can call in and cancel the service for a specific school without any special work being done. We have in the past disconnected service (For construction/rebuilds) but that has always gone through upper management with paperwork being signed. No disconnect was expected at this location, and the disconnect was done via a phone call.

Anyways, I just found it hilarious that they were able to cancel our service with a simple call (Thank god it didn't cancel the whole district's service). Perfect thing to start off a monday.

Recently (starting around Sept 29), we have been seeing a large amount of DNS queries coming from Xbox Ones on campus. The queries are always for nrdp.nccp.netflix.com and api-global.netflix.com. My servers respond appropriately, but the Xbox Ones continually request this information.

I received 3.5TiB of traffic on both Saturday and Sunday of this past weekend due to these requests. I've tried reaching out to Netflix and Xbox, but no luck yet. Wondering if anyone else has seen this or may have more information? 

Traffic graph, green is DNS: http://imgur.com/a/mtKfi

Update: In addition to Xbox Ones, we began seeing this behavior from Playstation consoles as well. These devices were identified as these consoles via a two-step process: 1) OUI lookup and 2) Voluntary self-identification from the students (they go through a wizard process to register their devices). I also am bringing an Xbox One onsite tomorrow to perform a packet capture local with the device to better analyze the traffic client-side. Hopefully that process will yield some results. 

Thank you to everyone who has offered assistance so far. I will keep updating this thread with information as I am able to, and answer questions I am able as well. 

Update 10/11 11:45AM Central: The next direction we're going is to reach out to the students individually and ask them to hard reset their consoles. As /u/asclepi noted, there are folks in the /r/xboxone subreddit who have had issues with the Netflix app starting on 9/29, same as when we saw this traffic begin. Hopefully after contacting them and getting some hard reset we'll see some drawdown of the traffic.

It's also worth noting that this has not negatively affected other services on campus, nor the bind servers from responding to other DNS queries. Some had asked why I hadn't banhammered the consoles or blocked all traffic to the servers. The response is that I will not involve students unless absolutely necessary, and not enough information was present to warrant their involvement until now. We also were not fielding any complaints from the student body about this issue so I didn't feel it necessary to bring to their attention until we could be sure on a direction that may require their awareness. 

Again, thank you all for the information and help, I'll continue to update as I get more info. 

Update 10/12 4:30PM Central: We have been reaching out to the students and having them hard reset their game consoles. Still waiting to see if there is a draw down in traffic due to this. I am storing logs in my graylog instance, but that's falling over a bit from the traffic load so it is tough. 
Does anyone have any contacts for someone in Netflix that's higher than Tier 1 support? I'd love to discuss with them and see if we can figure out what's going on.

We also got absolute proof that this is not an amplification attack or reflection. We shut down the port of a game console while it was sending these queries and observed the query stream stop and start again when the port was brought back up. So definitely some kind of console issue. 

Update 10/15 3:02PM Central: After reaching out to 15-20 students and having them hard reset their consoles, we have seen no draw down in the traffic. We're rate limiting it so it's not having a detrimental effect on us any longer. I know there are other network operators experiencing this issue, so I'm hoping someone @netflix.com will see this before too long and be able to provide some insight. For now, it's rate-limit and get on with our day but I'm very much interested in seeing this through to the conclusion.

I had to re cable an IDF so that it would look all clean instead of a horrible spiderweb. I decided this was a PERFECT reason to write some kind of script up that would transfer configs from one port onto another, and all id have to do is the pretty cabling.

Quick script descript:
    Have an excel sheet with two ports (7/0/1 , 6/0/1) per row, the first port is the config I need to transfer to the second port in row. 
It copies all configs into dictionary and then, defaults ports and writes configs one by one...


Well I use proverbial Python superglue and duct tape to get this script together, wait till after hours, run it..

As soon as I see that the script is collecting the info, I start uncabling everything and just enjoy unplugging dozens of cables. As soon as I finish I realize my script crashed due to some kind of timeout (havent taken the time to find out why exactly it crashed) right after defaulting all ports.......

gww2l3,networking,1591324748.0,"# Introduction

About a week ago, there was a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gsv5xv/rant_learning_to_code_is_not_easy_for_everyone/) on /r/sysadmin from a guy who was having a really hard time with coding and automation. As someone who experienced many of the same frustrations, it highlighted the need for education that is both relatable, and aimed at people who don't have a programming background. 


Fact of the matter is that coding *isn't* easy if you've never done it before, but neither is networking, or systems administration, or whatever your specialty happens to be. As with all things, they key is to start with the basics, and then build up to more advanced concepts over time. This post will be an attempt to provide a foundation to help folks feel a little less lost. 


With the introduction out of the way, let us begin. 

## What is automation, and why does it even matter?

Like many trendy terms, ""automation"" can mean something slightly different for everyone. For the purposes of this post, I'll keep it simple and define it as a ""force multiplier"", that is, something that enables you to do more with less by abstracting away the tedious stuff.


The ability to make changes faster how people usually try to sell automation, but I believe the real benefit lies in increased *predictability*. What does this mean? Well, by automating processes you:


1. Minimize the potential for human error and make deployments more predictable


1. Enforce standard configurations for resources to make their behavior more predictable. 

A practical example is in making VPN tunnels, where it's unfortunately easy for a tiny mistake to cause the whole thing to fail. You can reduce the risk of silly mistakes by making a script that takes a standard set of inputs and applies all the relevant configuration to your firewall.

Of course. it will still fail if your inputs are bad, but it's your job as the operator to make sure you're entering the right information. Computers are fundamentally stupid, so garbage input will always result in garbage output. 


On a related note, I intend to open source some of Ansible playbooks I've written for Palo Alto firewalls sometime in the near future so that there's an actual, tangible example to work with.

## Before you start
The first step, before even looking at any particular technologies, is to step back and take a critical look at your environment and ask yourself this:

**1\. What kind of problems do you have, and how will automation help solve them?**

This may sound like a dumb question, but I put it first because it's actually the most important. Technology should not be implemented simply because everyone else is doing it. Any undertaking that doesn't have a clear goal is pretty much destined to be abandoned. 

To that end, your first goals should be to focus on easy wins. Still doing config backups manually? Fix that. Want to find out what NAT rules there are on 10 different routers? Do it. 


Point is, have concrete goals right from the outset. and then move on to the fancy stuff. 

**2\. Understand that not everything should be automated**

Frankly, some things aren't worth the time or effort. As a general rule, if automation makes a process more complicated with no added benefit, then something's wrong.


## General principles

**1\. Be practical, not clever**


Generally, any code you write should not be convoluted and hard to understand. If you find yourself using crazy complex logic in your code, consider stepping back to see if the process can be altered to make it simpler. Doesn't matter if it's not the most elegant solution as long as it gets the job done reliably. 


**2\. Use good tools**

I've tried writing playbooks in nano and copying my files to a different folder for backups, and it sucks. Using a good editor and version control makes life much, much easier. Personally I use VSCode with git for everything, but I'm sure there are many other options as well.

**3\. Have realistic expectations**

Learning new skills isn't at all easy, but it's definitely worth the effort. Struggling to understand concepts that may be obvious to others doesn't mean you're dumb, it means you're gaining new experience. 

## What now?

I fully recognize that the contents of this post aren't actionable, but felt it was necessary as a sort of introduction. I also deliberately didn't go into details on any particular languages or frameworks because this is foundational information that applies to everything. 

The second post in this series will be more practical, with some example firewall changes in ansible using:

- simple variables
- arrays
- loops
- maps (dicts)
- functions (roles)

I'm using use ansible since I'm familiar with it and it's easy to understand, but these concepts will apply everywhere.

That's about all I've got for now; hopefully y'all found this useful.

I think they're useful for getting my CV up the pile but I'm seeing less value in infrastructure specific stuff and more in full stack knowledge or applications.

b8xudn,networking,1554297504.0,"Hi! First time poster here. Not sure if this is the right sub for this question - if there is a better place to post this please let me know.

So, the gist of it: I'm a computer scientist involved in a (social science) project to bring video-based e-learning to a remote university in [Gulu, Northern Uganda](https://goo.gl/maps/TKqPUtMrc912).

We want to offer the students of this university access to world class online video lectures, such as those from Stanford or other institutions. Many of these videos or courses are available online for free. The problem is that there's no inexpensive or reliable way for the students to get to these videos.

There is (glass fiber!) internet at the university, but it ends in the ""server room"" (if you can call it that). There is no WiFi network. There are three or four computer labs with about 400 decaying Pentium 4's in total, all of which are running some ancient version of Windows. The university does not get all the potential bandwidth from the fiber connection (which was installed by Google), but they are paying for something like 20Mbit. They are considering to increase it to 30Mbit or 40Mbit. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the university administration itself has decent computers and good internet. Students typically have cheap Android phones, and they all have 3G (or 4G?) internet through a mobile provider, for which they obviously pay out of pocket.

Within the university it's easiest to sell this project by using the [flipped classroom approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom): the video lectures don't replace the regular lectures, but they're given as homework.

So, **how do you get video lectures to these students**?

\- They cannot use the decaying computers (because they're decaying and because you can only use them while on campus, and not at home as homework). Also, it's unclear if the university's limited internet connection would be enough for this.

\- They typically don't have laptops or computers themselves, so that's out of the question too

\- You can't ask them to watch these lectures on their phone, because they would have to download them using their mobile data bundle, and that's really expensive (especially for large video files) so you can't just demand that from them.

So, **the plan I came up with** is to install a local mirror server that will download and host the video files, so that the university's internet connection only has to download the video once. Then, **I want to install a proper WiFi network** on campus so that students can connect to the university WiFi with their phones and download the video from the local video mirror server. I will probably have to develop a small app for that. Then, students can take the downloaded video file home at watch it as homework. Could work, no?

**However**, I'm a programmer and not a network engineer, and I have no fucking clue where to start. I will go there in early May for one week and would be able to bring and install some hardware.

The WiFi routers would be installed outside, in a humid and hot climate. I think it’s possible to shelter them from the rain, if necessary. We have to assume the power can go out at any time (regular power cuts), and we cannot make assumptions about the skill level of the people who will end up maintaining them - so it needs to be as fool proof as possible. The routers itself can/will be connected to ethernet. Additionally there’s a limitation as to how many devices we can take into the country: about 10 or so. Ideally [we'd cover the whole campus](https://imgur.com/a/QokDV2R), but if it's better (or more realistic) to only cover a part, that's fine. On good days there would be a few hundred students on campus at the same time (300 or 400 or so).

Our budget for this is about €5000…. Do you think it’s possible? Feasible, even?

At the CCIE level, a very large portion of this book is already ""common knowledge"" and therefore this book is very useful for review at that level.

It got me to thinking… traditional network engineering (tcp/ip, routing & switching) as a dedicated career field is not that old.  The Internet became increasingly popular in the mid 1990s, and Cisco released the CCNA exam in 1998.

Let’s say you were part of that first wave of CCNAs, a young professional out of college and got CCNA and your first networking job in 1998 at the tender young age of 21.  That means you’ve been working in networking for 24 years now, a true CLI Warrior.  You’ve seen some stuff!  But… you’re only 45 years old.  

The average retirement age in the US is between 62-65.  You’re nowhere near retiring yet!  You’ve still got another 15-20 years left easily… you’ll be a grizzled old engineer with 40+ years experience around 60 years old.


And that is when it hit me.  I’ve really never seen a grizzled old 60 year old network engineer.. with the notable exception of og telco engineers who pivoted to IP in the early 2ks, for the most part I don’t ever see old engineers like that.

I’m in my late 30s, and my motivation to continue learning new technologies is already way lower than when I was in my early 30s and especially 20s.

I never wanted to move into management or sales, but I’m starting to wonder: is that just the natural progression for our profession?

However, there are scenarios where it is very useful to have access to unregistered address space which isn't in widespread use the way RFC1918 is. This is especially true of complex organizations with lots of M&A activity, where there's no way to be confident that the next company you have to integrate into your network isn't already using the same 10.x space you are. Another potential use case is for short term network deployments by outside contractors, such as a proof of concept or a penetration testing engagement.

So, if you need some private IP space and for whatever reason you can't or don't want to use any of the standard RFC1918 ranges, there are some additional options when you dig deeper in the RFC's. Note that none of these are actually intended for this sort of use, and while everything should be fine as long as nobody else is doing the same thing, nothing is stopping anyone else from using them too. So avoid using any of these except when you genuinely can't leverage RFC1918, and remain consciously aware that there are no guarantees. If you absolutely need addresses which are reliably noncolliding with anyone else's space, get some registered IPv4 addresses, or use IPv6 instead.

**192.0.2.0 /24, 198.51.100.0 /24, 203.0.113.0 /24**

These three /24s, Test-Net-1 through 3, are reserved for use in example texts and documentation- the numeric equivalent of 'example.com' in DNS. If you just need a few small ranges of probably-non-colliding space e.g. for a NAT bridgehead or a shared-services datacenter vlan, these will probably cover you. These ranges are documented in RFC5737.

**198.18.0.0/15**

This large block of addresses is reserved for network device benchmark testing, with the intention being that by using this space you could be confident that high volume traffic in your test environment would not escape into production or into the internet. If you're not doing serious network performance testing, this space is wide open for you to use for anything else. This range is documented in RFC2544.

**100.64.0.0/10**

WARNING. This huge chunk of addresses should be considered as a last resort, and only if you are confident that you understand the risks. This range is reserved for carriers to deploy in NAT444 (CGN) environments; it should only be deployed with caution by end users in these scenarios:

* The devices with these addresses will never need to reach the internet, or will only reach the internet through a proxy server; or
* You have your own PI IPv4 addresses to NAT to; or
* Your NAT gateway is smart enough to handle the same IP addresses on both sides of the NAT table; or
* You have discussed CGN with your carrier(s) and are confident they are not and will not be using this space in the context of your network traffic

If any of those things is true then you have access to a truly huge range of addresses which is highly unlikely to be in use in any other private network you need to interoperate with. This range is documented in RFC6598.

And finally:

**169.254.0.0 /16**

WTF? That's the ""my DHCP server is down"" address range! Yes, yes it is. But this range is actually valid and usable address space *for link-local addressing only*. You can't (reliably) route to a 169.254 address from two hops away, which means it's no good for a client vlan or a device's primary management IP address; however, this range is perfectly fine for addressing a transit link such as a PE-CE /30 or a DCI connection. If you set up a Direct Connect link to Amazon AWS, the /30 addressing you'll get from Amazon for those links will use this range. It's also viable for isolated vlans with clients which will never need to talk off net, such as a dedicated storage or backup network, or some process control networks. In fact, addressing a PCN with 169.254 addresses ensures that those devices are not remotely attackable unless someone gains access to a jump host on that network segment. This range is documented in RFC3927.

Reminder: Don't do any of this. None of this is best practice, and any of it may blow up in your face. The number of scenarios where using these addresses is actually justifiable, is far fewer than the number of scenarios where an over-clever engineer using these addresses will cause more problems than the ones he's trying to solve. Unless you're working in an environment where multiple private networks under different management need to interoperate, this is almost certainly the wrong path.

- 1Mbps up, 1Mbps down, free.
- 5 Mbps up, 50Mbps down, $5/day. boo. 

The solution: multiple routing tables and some GRE tunnels back to a gateway router at corporate. 

I just built a virtual router with 9 virtual interfaces. I bound the first 8 virtual interfaces to my laptop's wifi adapter and let them grab DHCP addresses. Then, I built 8 GRE tunnels from the virtual router to my corporate gateway router, each using a different egress interface. Finally, I established OSPF adjacencies between my virtual router and corporate gateway router, load balancing across the 8 GRE tunnels using OSPF equal cost load balancing. 

Since the WiFi rate limiting is limiting connections (i'm guessing here) on either mac address or IP address, the rate limiting is now allocating the traffic paths 8 different QoS allocations, effectively giving me an 8Mbps up, 8Mbps down connection.

From there, it's simply a matter of routing my local computer's traffic through the virtual router, through the load-balanced GRE tunnels to corporate, and out to the internet, and using appropriate DNS servers.

I felt others here might get some value out of it, so i'm starting a new post with my response as the other thread is locked. 

This was the original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/aaapzi/how_much_reserve_bandwidth_for_videoconferencing/


I'm currently using a curved formula for estimating per-user internet connectivity average bandwidth requirements. 

- y= 0.0001x^2 + 1.4x + 30

https://i.imgur.com/kdQmmom.png

    Users =   10, bandwidth ~=  44Mbps ~= 4Mbps/user
    Users =  100, bandwidth ~= 171Mbps ~= 1.7Mbps/user
    Users =  500, bandwidth ~= 755Mbps ~= 1.52Mbps/user
    Users = 1000, bandwidth ~=1530Mbps ~= 1.51Mbps/user
    Users = 5000, bandwidth ~=9530Mbps ~= 1.91Mbps/user
    Users = 10000, bandwidth ~= 24030Mbps ~= 2.4Mbps/user

Explanation of my values:

1.4x: This is a basic Mbps per user estimate for concurrent usage. 1.4Mbps is higher than you probably need, but my formula is based around my network's observed usage and includes more than just VC and streaming. 

0.0001x^2: This represents the ""network effect"" of multiple users all having the software installed, whether they are using it or not. i've estimated 10Kbps of network traffic per user, per user, for various ""chatty"" things like wireless printers or bonjour bullshit. at 100 users, this is negligible. at 1000 users it starts to have an effect, totaling about 100Mbps network wide. at 10,000 users, network-wide ""background chatter"" is a considerable portion of overall network throughput. certainly not a majority, but a consideration. 

In my environment, all users' machines are more-or-less talking to all-users machines, so it might make more sense for you to adjust this portion of the formla to:

0.0001x * min(x,254), because it's unlikely in most networks for any end-user machine to be trying to talk to more than 254 devices (subnet size, or devices at an individual site, or whatever). 

30: This simply baselines the network circuit at 30Mbps. 

1 users? 31Mbps per user. 
2 users? 16Mbps per user. 
3 users? 11Mbps per user. 
4 users? 9Mbps per user. 
5 users? 7Mbps per user. 

However, with 5 users and 7Mbps per user, realistically, 3 users are working on word documents, 1 user is watching youtube (3Mbps) and 1 user is downloading a torrent from TPB (35Mbps). 

So, I throw 30 in there as a basic buffer against people sizing circuits for ""only a small branch office with 10 users, they only need 15Mbps, right? ""


I would suggest for typical usage this formula:

- $A = percentage of active users. (ex. 100 users, 15 max active, $A = 0.15)
- $B = max theoretical bandwidth of single active user (say Netflix @ 4Mbps + video conf @ 8Mbps, $B = 12Mbps)
- $C = bandwidth floor AKA peak download minimum (the smallest circuit you would want, or, the speed you need a single download to operate at. say 25Mbps? 50? 100? I use 30)
- $D = amount of bandwidth of ""chatty"" applications. I'm looking at you, bonjour. if you have 3 devices and you measure 400kbps of chatter total, average, then there are 3 device-to-device paths, so $D = 400/3 = 133Kbps = 0.133Mbps. If you have 50 devices and you measure 5Mbps of chatter total, average, then there are [N*N-1]/2 = 1,225 device-to-device pairs, so 5Mbps/1225 = 4Kbps = 0.0004, so $D = 0.0004. I use 0.0001. 
- $E = number of devices that could possibly talk to eachother per site. If you have 100,000,000 users, you don't have 1 site. This is the number of devices that could possibly talk to eachother directly, through unicast. if you have 5000 users at a site, enter 5k. if you have 50 users at a site, enter 50. 
- y = $D * X * min( X , $E) + $A * $B * X + $C


So, for example: 

if you have 20% active users at any given time (no more than 1/5 of your employees are actually ""using"" the bandwidth at the same point in time), 1 user maxes out at 7Mbps of video conferencing data usage, you never install less than 50Mbps per site, you observe 6Kbps per-user-per-user of ""chatty"" other bullshit traffic, your sites are limited to 1000 people, then you get this:

- A = 0.2
- B = 7
- C = 50
- D = 0.0006
- E = 1000
- Formula = y = $D * x * min( x , $E) + $A * $B * x + $C
- substituted = Y = 0.0006 * x * min( X , 1000) + 0.2 * 7 * x+ 50
- simplified = Y = 0.0006x * min( X , 1000) + 1.4x + 50

ok, so we get this formula based on those example constraints:

Bandwidth needed = 0.0006x * min( X , 1000) + 1.4x + 50, where X is the number of users at a site. 

That looks like this:

755q0d,networking,1507510797.0,"# The Curse Of The CLI

## **INTRODUCTION**

As **Network Engineers**, many of us agree that the CLI is useful. The CLI grants us valuable insight into our network devices, and a lot of what we do operationally relies on it. For instance, if you wanted to quickly check the **bgp state** on cisco devices, you can easily issue the command *“show ip bgp summary”* via the CLI. Overall, the CLI is good and generally useful, and has been for many years. Unfortunately, the CLI is not without its flaws, especially when it comes to **automation**.

&nbsp;

*Here’s where things get tricky*. If you plan to automate, the existence of the CLI is as much of a blessing as it is a curse. On one hand, understanding the CLI enables us to write more complex scripts besides just [simple configuration updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/6zc5vq/quickly_deploy_commands_with_python/). But, on the other hand, the CLI presents us with *unstructured* (*or raw*) information, and *unstructured*  data is a **HUGE** problem in programming!

&nbsp;

So what exactly do we mean by *unstructured* and why does it matter?

&nbsp;

## **UNSTRUCTURED VS STRUCTURED**

If you are new to the idea of unstructured data, don’t worry. The concept itself is straightforward.

&nbsp;

Imagine for a second that you need to figure out the name of a person. You can either ask for their name directly, or ask for their driver’s license.

&nbsp;

In the first option, you immediately get the intended answer. In the second option, you have to take an additional step to get the intended answer by first reading the driver’s license. You have to *‘parse’* through the driver’s license for your answer.

&nbsp;

And that is all there is to it! The first option is known as a structured response to your query, while the second option is unstructured.

&nbsp;

See the below figures for an idea of how this concept applies to networking:

&nbsp;

***Fig.1*** - *Unstructured Response Example*

https://i.imgur.com/36r7vWl.png

&nbsp;

***Fig.2*** - *Structured Response Example*

https://i.imgur.com/RzCOOu0.png

&nbsp;

The means at which you arrive at the answer to your question is very important in programming!

&nbsp;

In a structured scenario, your questions are essentially *‘keys’* and the answers are the *‘values’*. But, as automation is still relatively a new idea in networking, you will most likely not have the luxury of performing *structured* queries.

&nbsp;

By itself, unstructured data is not very helpful to a programmer. This is where parsing comes into play.

&nbsp;

## **PARSING FUNDAMENTALS**

**Parsing** converts *unstructured* (raw) data to a *structured* form. By parsing our CLI queries (e.g. *‘show’* commands), we will be able to interact with our data programmatically.

&nbsp;

***Fig.3*** - *Conceptual Representation Of Parsing*

https://i.imgur.com/faMZ3qw.png

&nbsp;

The catch is, parsing is only as good as the programmer developing the algorithm. The stability of your scripts is *highly* dependent on how strong the parsing logic actually is. This is because there is a **disconnect** between the network engineer automating, and the vendor creating the CLI.

&nbsp;

The vendor does not know you will be interacting with devices automatically through the CLI.  That is just not what the CLI was designed or intended to be used for. On a version to version basis, the output of any given command from the CLI can change slightly or drastically. Not only are you attempting to parse unstructured data, but you are parsing unstructured data that may change at any given notice!

&nbsp;

**SIDE NOTE:** With an API, the vendor assumes you will be interacting programmatically with the network device. This means the vendor has direct incentive to keep any changes in the output or structure of the API to a minimum. Another benefit of the API is that it only returns *structured* data! Many network devices do not yet support APIs, but that is slowly changing over time.

&nbsp;

## **STRICT VS FLEXIBLE PARSING**

Do not lose hope just yet! Parsing in these conditions is definitely challenging, but not impossible. You *can* develop algorithms smart enough to ignore most vendor changes. This is done by being flexible in your logic.

&nbsp;

The best way to demonstrate this idea of flexibility is through an example:

    R4#show ip int brief
    Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
    FastEthernet1/0            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/1            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/2            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/3            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/4            10.0.0.4        YES NVRAM  up                    up
    FastEthernet1/5            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/6            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down
    FastEthernet1/7            unassigned      YES unset  up                    down

&nbsp;

**Scenario:** You want to figure out what the ip address is for every single interface if it exists. 

&nbsp;

There are two methods you can take to accomplish this task:

- **Strict:** You can just *“assume”* every second word in every line is the address, except the first line.
- **Flexible:** You understand the format of IPv4 addresses. If an address exists on a line, then that will be that interface’s address.

&nbsp;

Let’s assume the vendor changes the output slightly:

    R4#show ip int brief
    Interface        OK? Method Status  Protocol IP-Address  
    FastEthernet1/0  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/1  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/2  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/3  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/4  YES NVRAM  up      up       10.0.0.4    
    FastEthernet1/5  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/6  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
    FastEthernet1/7  YES unset  up      down     unassigned  
	
&nbsp;

The **strict** version of the script will break as the addresses have been moved to the last column.

&nbsp;

I think you get the idea. Programming reliable automation scripts relies heavily on your judgement. Try to make as little assumptions as possible when parsing *unstructured* data. This way, if the vendor does change anything, it will not affect your scripts.

&nbsp;

I will go over exactly how to do this in more depth in the practical follow-up.

&nbsp;

## **FINAL THOUGHTS**

You should always keep in mind that the CLI was not made with the intention of being automated by the vendor. We are attempting to get around that limitation, but without any support.

&nbsp;

If you are new to automation, I can guarantee you will encounter many frustrating scenarios, but be persistent. The more you script, the more familiar you become with generating structured data, and the easier it gets.

We used old hardware that we had laying around - a Cisco 3602i (top), 14 3502i APs and a HP 5406zl switch as a power source.

The LED state on each AP is determined by which blade it's connected to on the switch. One provides only PoE and no link which produces a rapid red blink. One provides PoE and link but no DHCP which produces a rapid green blink. One provides PoE, link, and DHCP which produces a slower green/off/red/off blink. The 3602 was flashed to autonomous firmware and had the LED blink in perpetuity through a CLI command. Sadly you lose out on the blue LED in the pattern and only get a rapid red/green blink in autonomous vs CAPWAP. The lamp on top was graciously provided by one of my colleagues.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone!

I see that you got your licencing system hacked. I get that it hurts and you need to help contain the damage. But I think you're doing it at the expense of your paying customers. 

Today is the day I met my breaking point. I've been on a big project to upgrade a bunch of client site ASA firewalls and bring them up to date with the NGFW ASA 5500x series devices. So as of late we've been purchasing a fair bit of kit as we forklift the routers at the sites (probably 50 over the last 6 months). 

So last week we got hit with two licenses that won't activate due to their new licensing process for PAK's. Ok, fair enough, simple verification process to verify entitlement. First they want to have an invoice from my clients showing they purchased it from us, the amount they paid and sent by the client from their corp email account, among other things. Well that's a problem because I don't sell them to my clients but we provide them as part of an overall managed service. So that's hurdle #1. I explain this and they request our purchase invoices for the devices. 

Hurdle #2.  I finally round up the invoicing of where we purchased the devices from. One device is not from one of the big vendors we use (Read: InnoTekData, or MigraneMicro). We've ordered a lot from this vendor a lot, but I could see how it could be an issue. So I can accept there could be a problem here and I'll deal with that directly.

Hurdle #3. The first firewall that we bought during our planning and testing stages of this process over a year ago, was part of the big intel cpu RTC recall. We contacted Cisco and pulled the defective device, replacing it with another we had in stock. The RMA device that finally came direct from Cisco almost a year later was put back into our inventory. That is until we installed it at a client site. Following our normal procedure we go to add the PAK to our cisco account and BAM it won't activate and tells me I need to open a support case with Cisco. 

This is where it goes down hill. So already frustrated about the other activation failure that happened a day prior, I contact Cisco. Front line chat is helpful, but the new outsourced Licencing operations(Zensar), is atrocious. Simply will not answer any questions, or even address my concern about the PAK being direct from Cisco themselves. Just keep copy/pasting the standard block of text regarding the rejection. They just tell me the original license which I purchased was from a non-Cisco Authorized vendor was could be counterfeit and their inability to activate it. 

Even though I purchased the device that came with the stupid control license, Had smartnet on it.  Then replaced it and the original PAK with ones that were supplied by Cisco themselves in the RMA. So neither the original PAK or device even exist, just what Cisco TAC sent me as a replacement.

To me it's just a case of I'm sorry our system is totally effed, who cares if you got it as an RMA replacement? When you originally bought it it wasn't directly from us or our worthless vendors. So now sit and spin.

Gawd I'm just so pissed.... I know we're only part way into this project, but I just want to pull the plug, dump my inventory and go to another vendor. Even though my staff are all trained in this product, I'd almost pay for re-training just to be rid of your licensing cancer.

And yet, I regularly get tripped by 'stupid' or trivial issues. Most often because I inherit someone else's mess or someone else did the hardware before I got involved. But once in a while it is my own mess. 

Some of my personal favorites:

&#x200B;

* misconfigured spanning-tree

""Both devices have link on the right interface, in the same vlan, right IPaddress. Cannot ping. ARP ok. LLDP works, now it doesn't, now it works again. Hey, I got a ping response. Now it is dead again.""  Yeah, the box is very busy processing packets.

&#x200B;

* wrong BGP AS or wrong BGP auth key

""I have checked EVERYTHING. Why can't I establish this peering?""    No, I didn't check everything...

&#x200B;

* cat5 cables, missing locking tab on RJ45 connector

""I had link when I left. Or: It used to work with the other, older box.""    I rarely touch hardware anymore. When I do, dodgy, old cables have a very short lifetime. 

&#x200B;

* DNS not resolving to what I think it does

""Oh, you're talking to \*that\* nameserver. Or: oh yeah, there's an entry in /etc/hosts....""   But this is probably only me.... /s . 

&#x200B;

* wrong SNMPv3 auth or privacy \*protocol\*

""I \*know\* I set the right auth/privacy password. I just redid it for good measure. Still doesn't work.""  Most often when configuring a new type of device, and my NMS of choice does not have the exact combo of auth/privacy password/protocol configured.

105g5jk,networking,1673067061.0,"Introduction

I often participate in online discussions related to computer networking and datacenters. And of course there I like to share my own experiences about those topics there. However/ a bit of background information, about me, I live and work in the balkans. Some naysayers would say central europe, but 'ex-Yugoslavia' might be a better term. However for practicality I will call it 'the balkans' as for the purposes of this post I don't want to be confused with Germany or Switzerland.

Let's get back on topic. I like to talk online about my experiences in computer networking and datacenters online. However, all my experiences have been on the Balkan. When I hear the word datacenter, my first thought are the three local public datacenters I often visit and the local state run IX.

However, talking online, the internet is GLOBAL. And there is A LOT of survivor bias on the internet.The 1% of the best working in the best environments will dominate any online conversation due to survivor bias. My environment is the balkans, and I am certainly no genius. My networking experience is from the balkans.Someone working in networking in Germany is going to have a very different experience than I do. Someone working in networking in West Europe is going to have a very different experience than I do. Someone working in networking in south east Asia is going to have a very different experience than I do. Someone working in networking in the Congo is going to have a very different experience than I do. 

And boy, someone working in Silicon valley in computer networking is going to have experience that is like an alternate dimension different from the balkans. Like when I talk online to people from silicon valley, it is a complete disconnect from what I see in my environment.

But what is the difference? Well, let me do a comparison..Equipment... Naturally, silicon valley has the latest and greatest network, server and other datacenter equipment. and all of it is brand new. mentioning refurbishement is not unheard of, but it is already considered cheaping out. Equipment is replaced as soon as it is EoL, sometimes even when it is EoS(End of Sales).

Now in my part of the space rock. Most enterprise equipment is first boughtonly after it hits EoL/EoS. Datacenters in my region are still dominated by Cisco 3750 era equipment. Heck, old 2950 devices are still common. We buy Cisco Nexus 3000 switches which are EoL.And we are are still more modern and up to date than at least 90% of datacenter inhabitants in our region..We buy 15 year old Cisco ASR9Ks based on RSP440. Technically those are still supported, but they will never support IOS-XR v7 due to a lack of support for 64 bits. Aaaand we are still ahead of 90% of our datacenter neighbors on equipment capability/recentness. But, there is some new equipment in our local datacenters, most of the time it is called Mikrotik and Ubiquity. Can you spell cheap? Servers? Servers also lag usually 5-10 years behind. 

There is a real investment gap between silicon valley and the Balkans, who would have thougght /s. Credit where credit is due, my boss is not a penny pincher when it comes to network equipment. I guess that is why we are ahead of 90% of our neighbors. But put us in Silicon valley and we would be a laughing stock. Luckily we don't have any compliance requirements.

Network automation... In silicon valley network automation has become a part of the job for many network engineers. It has come to a point where automation doesn't even emulate CLI sessions but uses APIs. 

In the balkans however... I tend to work a lot with many regional ISPs. I only know one ISP where I know they do network automation for a fact. Network automation is viewed as nothingmore than an experiment for most network engineers here. Management support is usually lip service only, rather than a push for automation. 'Yes, automate, but automate on your own time.' Intent based networking? Haha.

Software defined networking in the balkans is a little bit better off, but that is mostly because it comes prepackaged with the network devices(Ubiquiti Unifi, Fortigate, Cisco Meraki). SD-WAN? I have yet to see SD-WAN in practice here.

MPLS and VPLS here are considered new technologies. MLAG is considered a new technology. IPv6 adoption is in single digits in most countires. In some counties still below 1%. Spine-leaf? Hah, hub and spoke.

These are just my experience within the regional datacenters and the regional networking industry, when compared to what I hear from people from America.

v671dw,networking,1654531793.0,"Preface: I failed the test (Cisco SDWAN ENSDWI 350-415)

TLDR: This exam personifies everything wrong with Cisco exams and actively makes me question the value of anything outside of the core Cisco Certs. I'm not upset because of the outcome as I've failed before, I'm perturbed by what the test was

I've deployed a few Cisco SDWAN environments from scratch, read the cisco guides, planned them out, applied policy, QoS and a few probably more obscure features (FEC, adaptive QoS) and have taken a actual instructor led class which was great so I figured why not try for the cert as a partial way to re-certify all my Cisco certs. 

I read the sdwan cisco press book book, watched another class on udemy, memorized all the bits I figured Cisco might throw at you like OMP timers and I was completely taken a back by this test. I've taken a dozen or so Cisco tests so I'm familiar with all the common pitfalls like badly worded questions, picking the best answer even if its not great, etc etc but this test had all of this turned up to 11. 

I'm not going give specifics because of all the rules and such but the level of detail you'd need to answer a lot of the questions goes into the realm of silly or unrealistic things to know off the cuff. This goes well beyond other Cisco test questions where you can sort of justify that in a super specific scenario you'd want someone to know or some corner cases, limitation etc whereas these questions seemed like they threw a dart at one of the design guides' appendixes, worded it badly and gave little or no context. One of the biggest things that put a bad taste in my mouth is how unrealistic the exam was as Cisco SDWAN is driven to be GUI based yet almost all were like you were configuring parts of it from the CLI which in almost all cases is not how you would do it and the only reason I can figure it was structured like this is because Cisco was too lazy or simply didn't care enough about the exam to make it properly. 

I've failed tests before, other Cisco exams (failed my first CCNA attempt and first ccnp switch attempt), etc and previously when I failed I looked at it and said oh I missed a key area, I didn't get into the right level of detail with something, etc but with this one I feel like studying and retaking is simply a waste of time. To memorize the things I think would be thrown at me for a reattempt would take well longer then the endeavor is worth so I'm moving on to something I think I'll actually gain value out of. 

I don't really even feel I gain any value out of retaking and putting it on my resume as I'll still list that I've worked with and deployed multiple Cisco SDWANs and if by not having the cert on my resume gets me passed over then I likely wouldn't want to work at that sort of place anyways. I took the test because I thought I could use it to partial re-cert (which I thought was the goal of Cisco when they redid the cert tracks) but the test really makes me question doing anything besides taking a core exam or trying to work towards CCIE which I have a different set of mixed feelings on. Ultimately you can argue any/all questions on these exams are valid/worthwhile but that only works in a vacuum and when you consider the reality of how actual work happens and that time, money, energy are limited I feel that Cisco is really shooting themselves in the foot because now I question re-certing at all and just focusing on better uses of my time like AWS certs, juniper, Palo, etc. If Cisco is going to go down to the level of asking what word is on page 86 of this guide sort of questions then what worth are they bringing to certify that.

Generally, prefer learning standard UNIX tools over OS-specific ones unless there's a clear advantage.

macOS-specific tools:

1. iTerm2 - much nicer than terminal. Learn its features
2. [Serial App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/serial/id877615577?mt=12) \- Great serial console. You can use `screen` or other CLI tools, but I so rarely need to use a serial console that having a GUI makes it a lot less mental burden.
3. Homebrew - A package manager. Purists may want to use [macport](https://www.macports.org/) instead.
4. [Copy 'Em](https://apprywhere.com/ce-mac.html) \- A clipboard manager with paste history, search, and favorites. I have it set to always strip formatting when I paste.
5. Magnet - A window tiling tool. Map it to easy-to-remember shortcuts and use it to position your windows different ways to use up all the screen.
6. Not a piece of software, but remap the caps lock key to escape (no software required, it's in system preferences). You need to use the escape key in vim and lots of other places, but rarely benefit from caps lock. Even if they hadn't taken away the physical escape key, I would still do this.

UNIXy stuff:

1. `brew install vim arping coreutils fping git ssh-copy-id pwgen tcptraceroute telnet nmap watch mtr`
2. Learn to configure you ssh client and shell environment to make routine things easier
3. Use zsh + oh-my-zsh
4. Learn vim. Start configuring vim. Start using vim plugins.
5. macOS has a builtin TFTP server. Plop files in `/private/tftpboot` and launch the server
6. `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are built in. Use them

&#x200B;

    # traceroute with ASN lookup and pipe output to clipboard. BSD-only option for ASN.
    traceroute -A example.com | pbcopy

fmkt32,networking,1584819499.0,"I'm sure this question gets asked a lot. I myself have scoured the web in search of the ""best"" layout for patching cables from the panel into the switches without running into issues like a bunch of excess cable length, or vastly different cable lengths. Terminating custom cables I'm sure looks nice, but is a pain in the ass, takes time, and you don't get as good of a cable with a man-made cable as a pre-terminated cable. Also, using more than 2 different cable lengths is also a pain in the ass, so How do you get a nicely dressed, intuitively laid out patch schema, using pre-terminated cables of only one or two different lengths?

I've been using what I would call an ""inside-out"" method, where you patch the outside of the patch panel to the middle of the switch, and work your way across, maintaining row for row on the panel and switch.

Obviously it works best when you have the same number of patch panels as you do switches/copper cards. -Sometimes you have to get creative when you have more patch panel ports than switch cards.

Rule of thumb being to never cross the center line of the ports.

[Example:](https://imgur.com/gallery/hUi9CkO) Patch panel A-1 would (on a 48-port Cisco switch) be connected to g1/0/23. A-2 would be g1/0/21, A-3 would  be 1/0/19 and so-on until you get to port A-13, which would go to G1/0/47.

Starting with A-25 in 1/0/24, you repeat the same process.

So far, in multi-switch or multi-card racks, I have been just going top patch panel to top switch, but I wonder if it would be better to go top panel to bottom switch and work inward panel to switch, so that bottom panel goes to top switch.

  This has allowed me to use the same length patch cable all the way across the switch and not end up with too much extra length or come up short. Generally I use 5 foot cables.

Since I mostly have to deploy this method on existing cabinets, it requires a re-mapping of the interface configs to match where they will land with the new port matrix.

Usually I do pre-work to save time during the maintenance window, but you could theoretically do everything on the same day.

Here's my process:

Step 1: document your existing connections. This is arguably the worst part of the process. Generally you can't rely on old documentation, and you have to be 100% sure of all of the connections, because they're all going to be moved. This means hand-tracing each cable (which is uaually a spaghetti mess in my current environment.) It helps to have a buddy with a laptop to document what patch port goes to what switch port, so you can focus on tracing, and call out what goes where when you find it.

Step 2: lay out your exiting connections and plan your new matrix.

In a spreadsheet, I take a copy of my current network layout and transpose it into columns and turn it into a table so I can sort by patch letter, or by switch port. Now is a good time to highlight important things, and also to find ports that aren't being used that can be disconnected. Hopefully if you're doing this, it's because you're either replacing or adding equipment to your rack or whatever and can plan growth into your re-cabling effort. This was the case for me in the example below.

[Example](https://imgur.com/gallery/CFPJ7Je) \*disclaimer\* I moved the green ports around to better distribute PoE load because they are AP's.

Step 3: map your ports to your new config:

Using excel, transposing your existing and planned port layouts can help you create tables so you can see what port configs need to be changed. I put two tables together showing the existing layout and the new plan, and then merge the patch panel port with its current and planned switch port. I then sort that list by the existing switch port number. This will show a sequential list of your existing switch ports and what new port that config will go on.

Step 4: build your config script.

Save your running config, and then copy out the interfaces portion.

Using the table, all you have to do is run down through the interfaces in the config document and change the interface number to the planned interface number.

(be sure to take out any ports that you skip from the config, so they don't overwrite the ones you change. Example: if your config changes port 1/0/1 to port 1/0/5, and you won't be using or moving g1/0/5 to a different port,  make sure you remove port 1/0/5 from your config script, or it will be written back to g1/0/5 when you paste in the config script.)

Step 5: do the migration.

You can do this part in whatever order during your maintenance window, but you'll need to disconnect all of the old patch cables from the switches, patch in your new cables according to your planned matrix document, and default all of the interfaces to blank configs, and then paste in your new interface configs from your plan config script. I would only paste in a handful of new interface at a time, to be sure you don't overwhelm the buffer on the switch.

Then you can go back through and fill in any (intentionally) blank ports with a generic interface config.

It helps to have plenty of cable wrap / velcro tape, tak-ty whatever you use to manage your cables on hand during this step so you can dress in your cables as you go.

Step 6: test / check-out

Since you can't really roll back (I mean, you can... you have the documentation to) you need to do checks and test. The more complex your network (more vlans, deviated port configs) the more you want to check and re-check. A lot of this process relies on a lot of focus on very tedious tasks like tracing cables and documenting them correctly and changing interface configs. You need to take your time with that, and also with your check out. I usually break it out over three days. Day 1 (hopefully a maintenance window) go in and trace down the cables and document the current situation. Day 2, during the week I build my matrix and my config script for my interfaces. During production I like to take a ping sweep of the switch, get running configs, CDP neighbor lists, etc. Day 3 (maintenance window) is when I do the migration and the testing.

I hope this helps somebody.

I don't get on much, but if you have questions about my method, or have some advice for me on a better way, please leave a comment or send me a message.

I'm also looking for new ways to name network drop locations and access points. (currently using a column grid, but sometimes there are no columns, or the drops are at different elevations/ floors.) preferably a convention that will fit on a patch panel label.

Thank you.

So one of our users needs to gain access to one of our VMs now that we are all working remotely, No problem I figure, fire up the VPN client, log into the firewall and create a new user and download the OVPN file and included client. In the meantime our cloud admin reply's he's got this, cool I email him and the user with the files and login info, figure all is cool.

&#x200B;

10 minutes or so go by and he says all is good, he whitelisted her Public IP at home, she can just RDP in. Wait, WHAT? (Not going to even get into the fact she has a dynamic public IP at home) We setup the VPN over a year ago so people that are offsite can VPN into our network and route from there so we only have 1 IP whitelisted (layers of security).

&#x200B;

 I get a hold of the said admin and let him know that he has the files in his inbox and I would highly recommend connecting that way (my title is just computer technician so I can't come down heavy handed). 

&#x200B;

After a few attempts the admin cannot get it to work, I do some googling and find a nice guide from a VPN website that goes over the install and import of OVPN file and which Client to use, forward this all to him. I figure, OK, we will be good now.

The emails consist of videos, exercises, and additional content/reference links.

The course is largely a beginners Python course. It is oriented towards network engineers that have some programming background (Perl, shell scripting, etc). While the content really is about Python basics, I try to have most of the examples and exercises be related to network engineering.  No pre-existing Python knowledge is required.

The content of the course will be as follows (subject to change): 

- Week1 - Why Python, the Python Interpreter Shell, Strings
- Week2 - Numbers, Lists
- Week3 - Conditionals and For Loops
- Week4 - While loops, Dictionaries, and Exceptions
- Week5 - Review and Exercises
- Week6 - Functions
- Week7 - Files and Regular Expressions
- Week8 - Modules and Packages
- Week9 - Classes and Objects
- Week10 - Paramiko SSH, Telnet, and Pickle

ptmijx,networking,1632367425.0,"I've been interviewing people lately for a Senior Network engineer position we have. A senior position is required to have a CCNA plus 5 years of experience. Two of these basic questions stump people and for the life of me, I don't know why. 
1. Describe the three-way TCP handshake. It's literally in the CCNA book!
2. Can you tell me how many available IPs are in a /30 subnet?

One person said the question was impossible to answer. Another said subnetting is only for tests and not used in real life. I don't know about anyone else, but I deal with TCP handshakes and subnetting on a daily basis.  I haven't found a candidate that knows the difference between a sugar packet and a TCP packet. Am I being unrealistic here?


Edit:
Let me clarify a few things. I do ask other questions, but this is the most basic ones that I'm shocked no one can answer. Not every question I ask is counted negatively. It is meant for me to understand how they think. Yes, all questions are based on reality. 
Here is another question:
You log into a switch and you see a port is error disabled, what command is used to restore the port? 
These are all pretty basic questions. I do move on to BGP, OSPF, and other technologies, but I try to keep it where answers are 1 sentence answers. 
If someone spends a novel to answer my questions, then they don't know the topic. I don't waste my or their time if I keep the questions as basic as possible. If they answer well, then I move on to harder questions. I've had plenty of options pre-pandemic. Now, it just feels like the people that apply are more like helpdesk material and not even NOC material. NOCs *should* know the difference.
People have asked about the salary, range. I don't control that but it's around 80 and it isn't advertised. I don't know if they are told what it is before the interview. It isn't an expensive area , so you can have a 4 bedroom house plus a family with that pay. Get yourself a 6 digit income and you're living it nicely.

Edit #2: Bachelor's degree not required. CCNA and experience is the only requirement. The bachelor will allow you to negotiate more money, but from a technical perspective, I don't care for that.

Edit #3: I review packet captures on a daily basis. That's the reason for the three-way handshake question. Network is the first thing blamed for ""latency"" issues or if something just doesn't work. "" It was working yesterday"". What they failed to mention was they made changes on the application and now it's broke.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ptmijx/interview_questions_too_hard/,Interview questions too hard??,Career Advice,169,402,0.91

Due a week ago. Lots of NAT, lots of policy-based routing. We made an acquisition - need you to merge the networks by Friday.

I have been an engineer since 2012 (not counting NOC, help desk jobs) and this has been the case for all of my jobs. The companies I work for hire the bare minimum number of engineers to keep the lights on. As a result - constant outages, constant one-off band-aid solutions. More band-aids to fix the band-aids that were already there. More NAT because we made more acquisitions and have no time to re-IP. More static/mroutes routes everywhere.

There is no time/budget for creating scalable, highly redundant networks. No time for automation. I've been doing this for 5 years and have not done automation once. All I do is fight fires. As soon as things get somewhat under control and we start talking about standardization, automation, etc., the company fires two of our contractors because ""we don't need them anymore"".

Ever since installation 6 years ago, whenever the power hiccups or lights flicker, the switch reboots. Running diagnostics through the CLI always shows that we have insufficient power to the modules. Our VOIP system is pretty tasking but we arent anywhere near the max power the backplane is capable of providing. I was putting together a proposal for an external procurve cabinet with failover power supplies in it. While pulling/referencing part numbers for power supplies, I discovered that the power supplies in our blackplane are 220v units.... but they are plugged into 110v outlets in our UPS. We specified our requirements to the vendor and used the heavy power cables that shipped with the switch which plugged into 110 just fine. Nothing odd looking at all.  
  
Apparently there is a power supply (J8713A) that only runs at 220v. They do have a switching model but it only provides 300w for PoE+. I specified double that output. That explains why I got the PS's I have. They provide 900. The sales rep screwed up and ive never seen a 220v plug that looked like a normal 110.  
  
Props to HP for building hardware like that that can run in a production environment for 6 years at 1/2 its required voltage every day without problems (other than power bumps)  
  
Ill be calling the electrician tomorrow.  
  
EDIT: Grabbed a photo of the plug this morning. Cant responsibly shut down until the weekend.  
[These are the plugs that shipped with the unit from Origin Micro.](https://imgur.com/a/cx6na) They are a 20A 110v plug. Not something I just found in the shop at the time. One blade is horiz and the other is verticle.  
  
EDIT: So.. I need to stop panicking and posting to reddit without being very thorough first. Thanks for the input everyone. Based on what I was able to discover and what I knew of the system, it looked like I was in trouble. I was able to get into the comm room this morning and have a closer look.

4xpf7o,networking,1471200198.0,"**TL;DR:** How does a network-connected device know a ""0"" was sent across the fiber? Is there some sort of established ""tempo"" of ""on and off?""

I apologize in advance for the ridiculousness of this question. I’ve been told I have the “attention to detail of a serial killer.” It’s just how I learn.

Ok, let's jump to the ""microscopic level"" about how networks function. Here's my thought process, in case I got something wrong along the way. This is how I came to my question.

* A ""1"" in binary code is electricity being sent across a wire.

* A “0” in binary code is literally nothing; no electricity being sent across a wire.

* Each bit is “pulsed.” That is, there’s a little bit of time between each electrical connection when it's transmitted.

* Imagine $Computer_A wants to send the binary code “111” to $Computer_B. Let’s slow down that data transmission a few bajillion times. It would look like “send electricity, stop sending and wait, send electricity, stop sending and wait, send electricity.”

* Now, $Computer_A wants to send the binary code “101” to $Computer_B. It would look like “send electricity, stop sending and wait, send nothing, wait, send electricity.”

Here’s my question. Since a “0” is literally nothing, how does $Computer_B know to translate “no electricity” into a “0” in binary code? 

Is there something in the rules of TCP/IP (I assume this is TCP/IP we’re talking about and not some other protocol) that determines the frequency of electrical pulses? In other words, is a “tempo” established between the 2 computers that says “the data transmission is X number of pulses per second?”

2f89yb,networking,1409630478.0,"Background:  
About a year ago I was contracted to setup/create a netflow capture box & an interface to the data (using pmacct, MariaDB, & PHP). 
The purpose of which was so the ISP could get a caching box from netflix and so they could better see where their traffic is going.


The question I still had (until recently) wasn't if the caching box from Netflix is worth the time and effort for someone who runs an ISP to setup, but ""how worth it is it?"".


Hopefully some here find this data as interesting as I do.


The data:  
Bytes:  
Before they were averaging anywhere from 70-110 TiB a week of traffic to netflix's ASN.  
Now the average is 30-40 TiB per week.  
More importantly their peak traffic dropped from ~1100 GiB/hr to ~500 GiB/hr which only happens when the cache refills.

Packets:  
Before they were averaging anywhere from 80-100 Gpkts per week to netflix's ASN.  
Now they avg 30-40 Gpkts per week.  
Here the peak has also dropped from ~1100 Mpkts/hr to ~550 Mpkts/hr when the cache fills.

Hourly chunk comparison graphs: http://i.imgur.com/71ySBBr.png (8,414px × 628px)  


Flows:  
Side note: Data here can be a little inaccurate as the same flow can last multiple hours.  
Before they were averaging anywhere from 15-20 Mflows per week to netflix's ASN.  
Now the average is 3-5 Mflows per week.  
Here the peak drops dramatically from 200-300 Kflows/hr to 30-50 Kflows/hr

Hourly chunk comparison graphs: http://i.imgur.com/XqhQw45.png (8,414px × 628px)  


As for how much traffic the caching box itself pulls in from external that comes out to ~12 TiB of traffic a week.


Now to answer my own question of ""how worth it is it?"":  
I'd say extremely worth it.  Knocking the peak in half and moving it to a time where there is less traffic overall is very valuable.
Also, for someone who has head-end hardware that has a hard flow limit this could be extremely helpful.

Every time someone asks me how to prepare for a networking interview, I'm at a loss for where to start. There are so many factors that can affect what you'd expect to see in an interview.

That said, there are some common bits, but giving people the same pieces of advice over and over again [makes me feel like this](https://i.imgur.com/MxYhO8b.jpg). I decided to update my YouTube channel with actual content for the first time in...geez, six years? Wow. We've gone through two revisions of the CCNA since then, I think!

[In any case, here's a video on networking interviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTqUSlJm4c) It definitely doesn't cover everything, but it certainly covers the most common pieces of advice I give. This is the result of years of in-person interviews and phone screens, and from a slide deck assembled by /u/HoorayInternetDrama. (That's right, I didn't forget about that slideshow you sent me almost a year ago!)

I'm definitely open to feedback on the content (production quality sucks, I know, working on that). Feel free to chip in with other morsels you think you would be useful to the community, also!

*Mods: I'm 99% sure this doesn't break Rule #5, but I don't want to break rule #3 either. My primary goal here is to have a post to reference when folks ask about networking interviews - not just at an entry level, because I see lots of engineers who should know better make the mistakes I mention. Hopefully the comment discussion can add more context than my video alone.

Also published on https://docs.sweeting.me/s/wireguard. It started as just documenting my setup, then I realized I could make it a real resource if I put a few more hours into it.

There are obviously many possible configurations that aren't covered by my main full-example, but it's a good CLI and config reference, and it serves as a place to start learning the basics of what's possible.

I think the biggest selling points for WireGuard are that it's faster and the config is easier. You can find some detailed performance comparisons here:
https://www.ckn.io/blog/2017/11/14/wireguard-vpn-typical-setup/

> Theoretically WireGuard should offer:  
> Faster speeds  
> Better battery life with phones/tablets  
> Better roaming support (mobile devices)  
> More reliability  
> Faster at establishing connections/reconnections (faster handshake)  
  
From https://restoreprivacy.com/wireguard/

If you value simplicity and minimal config surface area, WireGuard is also only 3,800 lines of modern C code with only a dozen or so lines of possible config options and simple symmetric keys, compared to OpenVPN and OpenSSL, which combined have around 600,000 lines and hundreds of lines of possible config. IPSec has around 400,000 total lines with XFRM and StrongSwan together, and anyone who's used it knows how crazy the configs and key management can get for complex setups.

p5laxy,networking,1629136453.0,"I  work level 1 tech support for residential halls at a university. We've  had the compounding problem of residents bringing increasing amounts of  printers and IOT devices on campus over the years that interfere with  eduroam signal quality, and this has resulted in us having to go out, check people's rooms, show them how to turn off printer wifi and  deactivate any device that projects a wireless network. This is a problem that it mainly handled by our smaller help desk until it has to be escalated. This year's batch of residents just moved in and the total amount of devices ITS reported to us were double that of the previous year, and we were warned that this would greatly degrade eduroam signal quality. For the first  time ever, our level 1 help desk was ***warned*** by big boy ITS that this would be a problem. So obviously, we're about to have quite the problem on our hands 😬

Our lvl 1 help desk has an average of 12-22 part time student workers. We  service about 30 residential halls, and most of them have at least 400 residents each. It was hard enough tracking down the hundreds of devices and having them turned off before this year (we didn't even get a fluke until a couple months ago, *after the residents were already gone*.), and it was a nearly insurmountable problem when we had to deal with it *last semester*. At this point, this is seemingly an ***impossible*** problem and I am wondering if we've just been going about this the wrong way. How do service desks at other universities handling issues like these? I was wondering if it's necessary to place restrictions on  residents telling them what they cannot bring on campus, but that's just my first guess, and of course not everyone follows the rules...

Also, campus internet is fine and dandy when residents aren't around. The wireless infrastructure isn't the best, but it works... Except when it can't because there are 9000+ rogue devices in the dorms.

Edit: I'm sorry, I should have stated before that not all of these devices are necessarily connected to eduroam. They're just sitting there, turned on, outputting wireless signals.

at57oz,networking,1550767125.0,"Hey all,

Thought you might be interested in a little project I've been coding lately. Use case if for embedded Linux applications that need long range, low data rate networking. They apparently used to make these 900MHz products called WaveLAN, but the only one on the market today (AvaLAN) costs nearly one grand a pair. So, I wrote a little program in Python to run IP networking over Digi's XBee 900HP (it would work with other XBees, but if 2.4 GHz is acceptable you may as well use WiFi) modules which are only $40 a piece. They have UART and SPI interfaces and of course you can throw in an FTDI chip for USB serial.

The modules have a 200Kbps RF data rate, and actual optimum throughput it only 30Kbps, so this is definitely a use case of M2M, embedded devices (unless you just like dialup speeds). They come with a proprietary DigiMesh protocol which is similar to Ethernet. You program each module's flash with a frequency hopping pattern, preamble, and network ID all of which must match, there is no join/deauth pattern like with WiFi. Regular MACs are used for addressing. The firmware has built-in AES encryption, which would be a good choice as TLS will reduce bandwidth even further.

Rather than broadcasting ARP packets to resolve the IP's, I made use of a ""node ID"" feature that comes in the DigiMesh protocol. The code sets the Node ID to a string representation of the IP address, and then uses built-in ""node discover"" feature to . The downside is that this incurs a fixed time penalty because it will always take the timeout to respond back over serial (the responding radio uses this time to avoid interrupting ""real"" traffic). There is a way to do broadcasts but they are repeated numerous times to ensure transmission across the mesh and so they would have a greater performance impact.

GitHub Link: https://github.com/aidanh010/StrangeNet

Demo Video: https://imgur.com/a/fLBiZx7

I actually wrote this for my high school robotics team to use for transmitting scouting data at events, because WiFi networks are banned (they are used for the actual robots and they've had interference issues before) and we didn't want to violate the spirit of the rule with a different 2.4 GHz network (they are fine with Bluetooth due to its low power, but its range is not at all suitable). We are using CouchDB so a way to send regular TCP packets was a must.

The original post made me realize how little I knew, and how helpful it would be to a) get more information on what their current setup looks like and b) to have someone on board that has done this stuff before. Since that original post I've been talking and working with /u/SuperQue, who like me happens to live in Berlin and is very (very) experienced in basically any kind of network stuff. So, together with him I've been trying to figure out how to deliver this project.

Basically, we spent the last week or so information gathering and doing some planning. It was clear that we needed more information in order to move forward. We initially assumed that there was not much of a network, and we would have to do most of it ourselves. We started designing for a completely independent Unifi network that would handle all WiFi needs. What we designed came in at around €3000.

But, we were both very uncomfortable trying to plan network changes without involving people there. It was very likely that we would be overbuying, or that we had assumptions that were just not true.

Eventually we were able to get in contact with the network administrator at Gulu University (it took some political maneuvering). He sent us their network documentation, and some photos of what's on site. It turns out things are vastly different from our expectations.

Here's what's available on their network (this is all /u/SuperQue by the way, not me 😁):

Core:

* Cisco ASA 5525-X
* Cisco C3850 24-port fiber distribution switch

Edge:

* Cisco 2960-X (No PoE, sadly)

Wireless:

* Aruba 7010 controller
* Aruba AP-215 - 6x (Indoor 11ac)
* Aruba MSR2000 - 8x (Outdoor 11a/n)

There are basic UPSs attached to all of the distribution switches. I haven't confirmed what kind of backup power they have in their NOC.

From what we've been told so far, 90% of the buildings are covered by their fiber network backbone. This is supposedly working ok, except for likely poor setup of the ASA. The network admin said that it was installed by someone else, but the University was given no training on how to maintain it.

But, the wireless is ""not functioning"". The network admin said that they had a WiFi range of 5 meters from the access point, so they had coverage issues (as he put it). My first obvious guess is that the APs just aren't getting adopted by the controller, or there is some other problem with the controller. We've been told that the MSR2000 APs have always been mostly useless and that the coverage they provide is minimal.

So my new tactic is to see if we can revive the Aruba gear.

* Get access Aruba controller.
* Find out what release they're on and debug whatever is wrong with it.
* Likely old release, research upgrading to ArubaOS 8.
* Price out a second 7010 so they have more capacity and failover.
* Price out replacement outdoor Aruba APs (AP-275, AP-365) for the old MSR2000 (I've been told that they probably won't work with ArubaOS 8)
* Price out additional indoor Aruba APs.

Other ideas:

* Research replacing the 7010 with a virtual controller setup. This way they can run the controller on commodity hardware.
* Used (ebay?) source a second 7010 (\~700 EUR) for backup + capacity.
* Used source slightly outdated APs.

If it turns out the 7010 is a lost cause, we will go back to considering the Ubiquiti replacement plan. The cost to repair with Aruba is now the more than the cost to replace the whole setup with cheaper gear.

It's a difficult decision, given that the most basic Aruba APs are three times the cost of Ubiquiti. /u/SuperQue has experience with Aruba gear, and knows how and why it's better for this kind of campus network. But we would have to use all our cash just to replace the 8x outdoor APs with newer models. This would probably improve coverage anyway, as they're much better MU-MIMO radios.

Any help on sourcing Aruba APs either in Uganda or German, especially if we can get EDU discounts, would be amazing.

Finally, we're on a very tight planning here, and whether or not the original timeline is feasible (to install everything by early May) is very much questionable. There are other parts that need to be done as well, for example the selection & installation of the server, and the pre-loading of that server with relevant videos. The tip to consider YouPHPTube for the video part of this project was extremely helpful, I've installed it with [docker compose](https://github.com/infostreams/youphptube-docker) and I think this will be the basis on which we build this project.

We recently hired a senior level to help me out and give me some more guidance to grow. So he interviewed great but I was reserved about him. He stated that he had racked and stacked, and was familiar with cabling.

This is where the problems started, I was covered up with work so my manager off loaded a simple switch config and cabling job to him. 

He didn't even know what cage nuts were.... WTF he came back and told us that the brand new fiber run was bad. We asked how he knew and he stated the links didn't come up. Asked if he ran a light test then he asked what's that. He didn't know you had to  swap one end of the fiber. Imean really should I be worried?

9qnhz5,networking,1540288941.0,"eNMS is a web application (Flask/Gunicorn/Nginx/PostgreSQL/Vault) designed to build workflow-based network automation solutions.  It has evolved a lot over the past few months, and I'm happy to announce the release of eNMS v3 !

Here's a brief summary of what was recently introduced:

- Custom services: most of you are building python scripts to perform simple network automation tasks. eNMS can integrate your script into the web UI, just like any of the ""default"" netmiko/napalm/ansible-based services. If your script takes input parameters, eNMS will automatically generate a Flask form in the web UI. In a way, eNMS is now like Ansible Tower, except that, instead of having a workflow of playbooks, you can build workflows off your own python scripts.

- Your network topology can now be automatically imported from OpenNMS (REST API) or Netbox (with pynetbox). 

- eNMS is now configured to use a PostgreSQL database + a Hashicorp Vault to store sensitive information such as network credentials.

- Web SSH: you can now SSH to your switches/routers directly from the web UI with a web-based SSH solution. For instance, from the geographical view, you can click on a device, then click on ""Connect"" to open a web SSH terminal. This works even if your network is behind a jumpserver, as long as eNMS is installed on the jumpserver. Optionally, eNMS can automatically authenticate you (credentials are fetched from the Vault)

- Event-driven automation: Services and workflows can be triggered by an external event in two ways: via a call to the REST API with the name of the service/workflow, or upon receiving a Syslog message that matches a preconfigured rule.

- There is a dockerfile to start the application as a container, and a docker-compose file to start it with PostgreSQL database and Nginx web server.

# Main features for the next release:
    
- Notification system for when a service ends: mail-based (eNMS will send an email with the logs, what went wrong, etc) or slack-based (slack notification)

- Interface with Gitlab (push the logs of a service to gitlab, etc)

- RADIUS + Active Directory authentication (currently has only TACACS+)

# More

Networking is a fun and interesting field.  We're all weird in our own ways.  We all come from different networks and industry.  Small shops, big shops, small budgets, big budgets.. we have it all here on /r/networking.  

This isn't a ""my penis is bigger than yours"" post.   I'd like to know about your network (you don't have to explain everything if security is a concern) . I don't care how big or small it is (thats what she said.. yeah yeah) . I don't care if it's a Linksys router, Juniper, Cisco, Enterasys, White Boxes, RIP, OSPF,  IPV6.. whatever.  

What's everyone supporting these days?

RULES:  
NO JUDGING ENVIRONMENTS.  
PLEASE - NO BASHING PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING/RUNNING/USING/WHATEVER.  

Previous Environment (6 years ago):
Cisco Shop
6500 cores, 5500/6500 closet switches, MPLS, T1s, DS3's, 100Mb LAN everywhere. I saw that network go from 10Mb TokenRing , to 10Mb to 100Mb ethernet.  Seen some IPX and novell.  EIGRP LAN, OSPF to mainframe, RIP for legacy. OS2 to Windows XP.  Been there... 

My Current Environment:
(I'll avoid most Security items but give some basics on network)
Cisco Shop. 
100% EIGRP routing.  Replaced RIP around our ring 6 years ago.

- 10 Hospitals (10Gb ONS 15454 Optical ring between them)

- 300 Remote Sites, Ethernet (fiber) to all remote sites.  Single links (no redundancy) - Speeds 20Mb, most sites 100mb - 1 gig.  We have a very personal relationship with our provider. If there's an issue they will be there 24/7 until the issue is resolved.  Nice to have connections with the owners. 

- 100+ VPNs to vendors (Cisco ASA 5520's - replacing with FP 2130's using ASA code. Sorry no FP code here)

- Remote Access VPN - Cisco AnyConnect 

- Radius - Windows 2008 R2 (NPS.. yeah I know)

- Meraki MX65ws  to Mx250's for new Radiology setups

- LAN Cores :  6500e VSS Cores,  6800s VSS, 9500-40x (VS)

- LAN Closets: 3750s(48p) 3850(48p), 9300's(48p)

- New closet switches are dual 10Gb OM3 Fiber back to cores.  - - 

- Old Closet switches are 1GB OM1 62.5 back to cores. 

- Each hospital has an isolated Biomed Core and network. GE signs off on each switch after testing.

- Data Center:  (2) Colo's -  2 Nexus 7ks per site,  Nexus 5ks and 2ks for TOR. OM3 Fiber 40gig to VMs, 40gig to 5ks.  Upgrading 9ks this year.

- Firewalls: CheckPoint with most features turned on. Sorry, no VPNs on these boxes.

- Content Filtering:  Blue Coats. Firewalls GeoBlock most countries.

- Cisco UCS / VMware shop  1000+ VMs per DC. 

- OTV between DC's. Sorry no Vxlan guys.

- Current Internet: 1 gig (bumping to 2Gb soon)
- Internet Upgrade: Breaking out radiology VPNs to dedicated 1 Gb
- Internet Upgrade: Breaking out Guest wifi to dedicated 1Gb

- 3000+ Cisco wireless APs.  
- 2 Wifi controllers per campus
- Wifi controllers: WISM2's, 5500's through 8500's

Misc Software:
Prime, MSE, ISE, SolarWinds, Ansible, Forescout, Symantec, misc Siems/logging/security devices (can't say).  Different 10Gb Gigamon TAP setups across the network to grab traffic for looking.

- Solarwinds for network/server monitoring.

- SSL inspection on all outbound traffic.

- Email: Microsoft/ Proofpoint/ 0365

- Cloud:  Azure - VPN (To Cisco FP VPNs 2130's running ASA code)  . Putting in dual Express route connections now as we ramp-up the cloud. 

- 2 Factor authentication on VPN's, O365 services

- We run spanning-tree (rapid pvst) through our campus locations.   No routed closets - Sorry ECMP fans out there.. I can't do it yet due to a lot of legacy stuff that floats around.  But we're close.. next building we'll try :)

- One location runs Spanning-Tree MST -  Exceeded 128 vlans on my Cisco 9500-40x's .  sigh* 

- I still buy Cisco Optics.  But we're looking at FS.Com now (cheers)

- We have a few 100Mb wireless shots between buildings. 

- Still running Cisco ASA 5505's for quick office spin-ups on cable modems.  Now moving to Meraki MX65's to spin them up faster until circuits are installed.

- Cradlepoint 4g routers for quick-lite setups. Cradlepoints in mobile vans that move around the area.

- OpenGear 4g Out of Band console access. 

- APC for our UPS devices.  Though we do have some Leibert units.

- Every closet that runs 3750/3850/9300s uses stacking cables with stacking power.  With primary to street power, and secondary to UPS

What are you working on??

- I'm researching OSPF and IPV6 now.. so in a few years I'll have something ready.  I may run this along EIPGRP IPV4 network.

- Ansible - To query devices

The Real World:
- While we have some really nice networking closets (IDFs) and (MDFS).  We have old some stuff we're not proud of. Closets put in old bathrooms, core routers sitting below sewage pipes,  closets that have no room for wire management, switches bolted to walls. Switches near boilers and no AC in some closets. You make do with what you can.

- Some recent buildings we took over..  they had CAT3 and switches in the ceiling. It is what it is... so we have to run all new fiber/cable/power...  but we'll fix it. 

- Service Now for tickets

- We were previously a Nortel shop.  Every once in awhile we'll find a Nortel switch powered down in a strange place that we never removed.  I actually think I have one still running some telco PBX or something.  Hey, I'll get to it :)

How many people: 
- 1000+ switches/routers (At least) -  1 ccie architect, 2 senior engineers, 4 network engineers. 

How do you do it?
- Like (or unlike) you..  we have a huge list of To-Do's on top of our normal lights on support and projects.  We do our best every day to keep things going but we miss stuff.  It happens.  Our area of healthcare is growing at a rapid pace so we are doing our best to keep up with demand.  I think the thing that keeps us going is having a strong team that backs each other up. If we have an outage we reach out to a few members of the team (even if you're not on-call).  If its a major outage (Like water pouring over your core routers, long story) we'll have one person running tickets, 1 person on a incident manager call to relay information to upper management, 1 person working the issue, and a 2nd to assist with whatever.  We stick to a standard list of equipment so if something fails we have the part in our spare-pool (warehouse).   Having standard parts available is a life saver!  Having your configs backed up in a common / available place is a life saver!   We all learn from each other.  No one thinks they know it all... they don't.  Work as a team, share the information you know, and we'll all get through this together!

So..  What's your story???  What's your network?  Got some fiber channel.. DWDM,  have some TokenRing? Got some Fiddi?  DS3's  MPLS.. VPNS..  Share..    Running RIP and proud of it!!!    I have static routes on my cores for stuff.  What you got!?!?   :)

- Motavar

PS: Have fun with this post.  Please.. no bashing.  If you have a router or switch with a really long uptime, Post it!  My last place I had one up for 7 years! 

6/7 - UPDATE:  
Thanks again for those that have shared so far!  Keep adding to the list so others can see what is really running out there in the world.
So many different networks and equipment...  you guys have me ""googling"" a lot of stuff!!

nlmg07,networking,1622049909.0," I work at a service provider and am helping a client with a new office where they have a 10Gb Spectrum Enterprise fiber circuit. We have been troubleshooting with Spectrum for 3 weeks, and after 2 weeks, found an issue where the Spectrum policing is restricting outbound internet traffic to less than 2 Gbps per ""flow"".   

However, after confirming the policing is causing outbound traffic issues, Spectrum has re-enabled the policing and now the client is affected again. Spectrum calls it Large Flow Policers and has said the policers are ""needed"" and that ""LFP is implemented on the Spectrum network to protect our clients from link saturation"". Neither I nor my client have ever heard of this from an internet provider and has effectively reduced a 10 Gb circuit to a 1-2 Gb circuit. Has anyone ever heard of Large Flow Policers (LFP)? I don't understand how this decision doesn't break every contract with Spectrum Enterprise to create this disruption or failure of service. This sounds like some Mickey Mouse crap I might see in a residential setting, not an enterprise one. Especially for a client like mine that relies on the ability to upload large content on a continuous basis.  We are constantly seeing discards on the edge next to the Spectrum ADVA where traffic is being refused.

None of this policing was discussed with the client prior to signing the contract with Spectrum Enterprise and at this point, I would never recommend them for any business.

94dpc1,networking,1533332337.0,"So this is a situation that happened today. My company deployed Cisco ISE a couple months back, and, despite a few problems, I'm really enjoying ISE. Now obviously a lot of trouble tickets that come in now a days are just adding a phone or printer MAC to the Identity Group or whitelisting a PC MAC temporarily so we can push new certifications to the PC.

Well this one customer in particular has been needing a new MAC added every other day, so this morning I decided to look at all dot1x failures on that building's switch and then go out there and fix them all at once. I look through the list of MACs, and I notice one MAC looked odd. A completely different OUI than any other device on our network. I check that failed authentication session in ISE, and notice that it labels the Endpoint Profile as Nortel. Thats odd, because we shouldn't have any Nortel devices. I search in ISE for the first 6 of that OUI and notice that we have 4 Nortel devices on our network. Our network currently has 3,000 dot1x sessions active, so 4 Nortel devices is really odd.

I also notice that 3 of the Nortel devices have authenticated with the PC dot1x policy, which means they are authenticating with certificates and not MACs. Better yet, theres one Nortel device in the building I work in, connected to the same switch as me! I tell my more senior network engineer, and now we're both interested. Its very unlikely these devices are rogue machines if they are authenticating with certificates, but still, we're both wondering what Nortel devices could be in use. We immediately go to question the sysadmin shop, but they have no clue. We figure out the switch port the device is connected too, and also the wall port number labeled on the path panel. We hunt all over the offices looking for the wall port, but there's no real rhyme or reason to how they were labeled and large desks cover most ports. Finally, the senior network engineer spies an interesting looking laptop. It just so happens that the laptop in question was mine. I, for some reason, was issued a Lenovo laptop, while the other thousands of ends users use mostly HPs. I tell him thats mine and its a Lenovo, not a Nortel, but he still insists I check my MAC....

Lo and behold, I was the rogue device.  I can only assume that Lenovo must have bought Nortel NICs or something along those lines, which is why ISE displayed the device as Nortel.

8q46bm,networking,1528667270.0,"So the user /u/EtherealMind2 (who I believe is a famous CCIE Blogger?) posted something in another topic earlier that has been bugging me for a while now.

He said basically don't use QoS on a campus network, because it will usually break things that wouldn't be broken otherwise.  When I asked him to elaborate, he declined, but I've been thinking about it and reading a lot and I've come to a conclusion.

Almost all texts on QoS, including Cisco's ""infamous"" End to End QoS book all agree on one simple fact: ""a bad QoS policy is worse than no QoS policy.""  Basically, if you can't figure out how to fine tune the QoS to your environment, if you don't know **exactly** what you're doing, what each nerd knob does, and how it all behaves, then you're better off not even having policy-map's period.

The more I read about QoS, and the more I experiment with it, the more I'm convinced that it's basically impossible to write a ""good"" QoS policy.  I mean, no one can tell you what a good QoS policy is.  It's the one configuration that everyone sorta has to stumble through, and as much as I hate to say it:  It is basically rocket science.

The deeper into the woods you get, the hairier everything is.  I tried adjusting some QoS policies on my network, changing the buffer ratio and whatnot, turning ""nerd knobs"" to try to fine tune stuff.  It pretty much always resulted in dropping more of the traffic I didn't want to drop!  Eventually I gave up and turned all the nerd knobs off leaving only ""bandwidth percent"" commands in each class, and the results were like a million times better.  I no longer dropped anything other than best effort.

So now we're approaching the part of my rant that may get me downvoted or disagreed with--I'm starting to form the opinion that a very, very small percentage of networks out there have ""correct"" QoS policies on them.  I feel like a lot of people on this sub even, and just out there in the wild in general, think they understand QoS and have this nice configuration on their network, and it may not cause problems that anyone noticed--but I'd say probably around 90% of them could just no out all of it, and not notice any differences either.  Or actually *improve* performance by just removing it completely.

Even certain data center design I know that uses spine/leaf architecture basically says to turn off QoS or ""if you need QoS, you designed something wrong.""

QoS just black magic fuckery, one that almost no one out there can properly harness, I feel.

EDIT: Also one simple fact I found funny, no one really posts actual QoS configs on /r/networking , because they know deep down ppl will pick it apart and QoS is the one configuration most people aren't truly competent nor confident in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/8q46bm/does_qos_cause_more_harm_than_good/,Does QoS cause more harm than good?,,157,124,0.91

57dugn,networking,1476407428.0,"After spending quite a while developing the Flow Analyzer project and doing a closed beta, I think the first version is finally ready to be released.

The [Flow Analyzer project](https://gitlab.com/thart/flowanalyzer) integrates your Netflow v5, Netflow v9, and IPFIX flow data with Elasticsearch and allows you to graph and dashboard it in Kibana. It's a full stack solution with custom collectors written in Python, additional flow tagging and categorization logic, and storage in Elasticsearch. Once your flow data is tagged, categorized, and stored it can be visualized in Kibana.

Take a moment to check out some of our [Dashboard screenshots](http://www.manitonetworks.com/dashboards/) and [other Visualizations](http://www.manitonetworks.com/screenshots/).

This project is built on Ubuntu Server and is designed to run with [minimal requirements](https://gitlab.com/thart/flowanalyzer#requirements). The entire installation process is documented from end-to-end, and almost everything is scripted. All you need is a fresh installation of Ubuntu Server. Searches, Visualizations, and Dashboards for Kibana are included in the project so you can get up and running quickly. If you've never used Elasticsearch or Kibana before don't worry about the learning curve, it's all handled for you. I've also included Kibana searches and some example Elasticsearch queries for reference when you want to write your own.

My goal is to give everyone the ability to do cool stuff with their network flow data, and to make the real insights and beautiful visualizations bigger teams are producing more accessible to everyone. 

Some features are still in development (e.g. IPFIX Option Templates), and the Python code certainly isn't pristine or perfectly pythonic. However, if I spend forever tuning and tweaking then none of the project will never see the light of day, and I want people to do great stuff with their data.

Check out the [project page on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/thart/flowanalyzer), then the [installation documentation](https://gitlab.com/thart/flowanalyzer/tree/master/Install) - from installing Ubuntu Server to having graphs in Kibana takes less than 1 hour.

I hope people find this useful, and that I can bring someone joy and excitement when they look at their data and see

I don't know too much about QUIC and after falling down the [rabbit](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/98/materials/slides-98-edu-sessf-quic-tutorial-00.pdf) [hole](https://lwn.net/Articles/745590/) for an hour or so, I emerged with a basic understanding of it.

The idea is that TCP is too slow and middle boxes are too aggressive in muddling with TCP flows, so QUIC runs on UDP.  It assumes the useful functions of TCP and brings them up a layer, so the application deals with managing window sizes, acknowledgements, and congestion.

The philosophy of QUIC interests me more than the technical implementation.  What some of us know on more personal terms - systems and networks are opposing forces - has reared its head within a modern standard.  In my experience, network engineering's wants and needs are at odds with systems engineering's wants and needs.  In my opinion QUIC is a modern manifestation of this opposition, standardized!

We stand at the precipice of convergence, where networks and systems join forces.  SDx, NFV, DevOPs/Infrastructure as Code, etc., are supposed to be the new guiding principle of our (systems and networks) future, but Google saw the problem with this idealism and the IETF clearly digs it, and now we have HTTP/3.  A protocol explicitly designed to work around not just TCP's limitations, but the limitations imposed on TCP traffic by network nodes.  Namely firewalls.

If syn, syn-ack validation is no longer an option, a foundational feature of firewalls is rendered moot.  If all data above layer 4 is encrypted, many of the NGFW investments in DPI are rendered moot.  The security push for zero trust is an interesting one and it seems like QUIC might mainstream some of those ideas.  Maybe the network can knock off some of its feature creep (ossification, as the QUIC folks like to call it) and go back to a more commoditized state.

26lwpl,networking,1401201603.0,"Ok. Okokok. My apologies for the click-bait-y title. I'm not a hacker or cracker (I *am* very white though) and this isn't hacking.

Did you see this thread about packet analysis? [Why don't more people know how to do packet analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/23lwuk/why_dont_more_people_know_how_to_do_packet/)

That discussion inspired me to start making some packet analysis content. Not ""here's every damn button in Wireshark"" type videos. I can watch a video that explains all the buttons and dials of a 747 cockpit but you still probably don't want me flying it. I wanna show you how to apply tools to solving problems and understanding networking at a greater depth.

Admittedly, my first video isn't so much packet analysis as it is just something fun to do with packets. Going forward, I'll be diving into things like:

* TCP performance fine tuning and troubleshooting
* HTTP performance fine tuning and troubleshooting
* What the hell is TCP Window Update and should I be concerned?
* Wireshark says there are retransmissions...am I going to die?
* Sure, I should read RFCs, but which ones and what are they really saying?
* I have a 1Gb link to the moon, how fast can it really go?

These are just off the top of my head, maybe I'll do 'em, maybe I won't. I want to make stuff that you'd find useful and interesting.

Why am I doing this? Well, I just moved into a management position in my career. The packet analysis and troubleshooting knowledge I have was a lot of effort over many years to gain and I don't wanna lose it totally. Plus, I love you. Like, inappropriately so.

Ok. On with the show. If you like packets, I think you'll find this lil video interesting. Oh, remind me to tell you about the time this helped me get a job and move across the country to NYC.

Key point is that you’re adding lanes to the highway, not increasing the speed limit. Link aggregation is done for load balancing and redundancy, not throughput - the added capacity is a nice side benefit, but not the end goal.

This is very good news from a security standpoint!

Visual of what is being removed: [https://imgur.com/a/Om9slKo](https://imgur.com/a/Om9slKo)

**What this means for organizations:** if you're not using strong authentication for network access, aka certificate-based authentication (which you should be), and continue using legacy EAP methods & weak credentials, you need to start configuring supplicants properly. Tunneled EAP methods with weak credentials should only ever be used with managed supplicants (MDM, GPO, etc).

Here is a properly configured supplicant for tunneled EAP methods (EAP-TTLS, PEAP): [https://imgur.com/a/qNQg6t0](https://imgur.com/a/qNQg6t0)

If you have instructions for end users that tell them to select ""Do Not Validate"", you should force password changes ASAP, update your documentation, and start working on a migration plan towards strong and modern authentication.

tl;dr stop using weak/legacy authentication methods

**\[Additional Info\]** This was originally posted as a comment but I'm moving it here 10/9/20 13:55

Here is the WPA3 specification which states that Do Not Validate is not a valid configuration for server certificate validation. So while this is not ""Android documentation"", it will hopefully highlight that this is an industry change over time and will not be just Android.

Android decided to make this change now as there are so many organizations in the wild with public documentation telling users to disable cert validation.

4iwa5f,networking,1462990521.0,"**UPDATED 7/21/2020**

So I ordered some ebay switches.....

Despite knowing full well this isn't the best idea, I did it anyway. They were half the cost and I get a return window if needed. I have the budget for legit gear if I need to replace them. That said...

There are several things about these two switches that seem super suspect to me. I've linked a albums so that anyone who wants to take a look can see what they think. I've compared them to each other and to another switch that is a legitimate Cisco product. 


1.) The text on the front panel looks iffy.

2.) The blue color on the console port isn't the same as Cisco blue.

3.) The yellow around the status lights is brighter and not the same.

4.) The mode button is almost flush with the front panel rather than sticking out.

5.) All 3 switches, the two possible fakes, and the 1 legit all have different parts inside despite being the same model and revision.

6.) Most curiously, there is a small daughter board on the bottom of both of the suspect switches. The legit switch doesn't have it. I've never seen Cisco use anything like this in all my time working with them. Nor have I ever heard of a report of anyone else seeing this. I do recall a while back that someone discovered that their gear had been intercepted by the US Govt. and modified to report back. I'm wondering if that's what this chip is doing. That or circumventing some encryption schema that Cisco has going on in order to load legit software onto fake hardware. You can see the boards in the photos in the albums near the bottom.


I currently have one of the switches connected to the internet on a Charter cable modem and I'm monitoring the port with wireshark and a laptop. This whole setup is self-contained and completely separate from my network. Mostly looking to see if anything fishy is being sent out across the wire. I'm open to suggestions of things to try if anyone else is curious. I welcome it actually. Feel free to inspect the photos as well and provide feedback on them.


I'm in contact with Cisco and they are investigating the devices. Just wanted to share my experience and see what others had to say.


http://imgur.com/a/tzXss

http://imgur.com/a/FssK7


Edit: Just a side note. These could be perfectly legitimate specimens and I'm just being overly paranoid. Figured it's better to be safe than sorry. I also believe a discussion of suspicion is healthy for the community as a whole. It helps us all be more observant to things we wouldn't otherwise think about when acquiring gear. 

**Update 5/12:**
So I took apart the switch again and took a few more photos. Some are just interesting observations and others are relevant to your questions. Some pink ink on the board. A random push button switch that doesn't exist on my legit unit. Some photos of the front and back of the bug. I so tried to take a photo of what the bug is connected to on the opposite side of the board. It's the small IC above the rectangle full of numbers. Found some more really horrible soldering as well. Looks like a poor repair to me. FWIW, there are no markings on the IC on the bug at all. I've shone multiple flashlights at it and wiped it with some alcohol. It's blank and it doesn't appear that anything was lasered off. It was manufactured blank.

http://imgur.com/a/PytvX

In addition I was contacted by Cisco about 20min ago and was asked to mail them the switches. To me this indicates that they are unsure of what they are seeing but know that they didn't do it this way. Or they know what it is and don't know how it escaped. At the very least, something doesn't seem right to them. They are going to mail me loaners in the meantime. We'll see what happens!

**Update 6/22:**
Don't get too excited. I've reached out to Cisco to see if they have looked into the units and/or if they have any information about what they found. If I get anything out of them I'll update again.

**Update 7/6:**
So Cisco never got back to me. I don't expect that they will. Therefore I'm willing to share details about where we got these so that you fine folks may purchase your own and dissect them at your leisure. We ended up ordering two more switches from eBay and it turns out they are identical to the ones I shipped to Cisco a few weeks ago. We are planning on returning these to the seller. However, if anyone can give me links to products, I'd possibly be willing to debug these boards if I can do so quickly. If the tools aren't too expensive anyway. I'm fairly smart and can follow directions so please reach out if you have suggestions. Amazon links with prime shipping would be best. I'm sharing the seller details so that anyone willing to do the same, can. I don't feel any obligations to Cisco at this point as they won't return my calls, as it were.

vcx544,networking,1655306989.0,"TLDR: The networking job market still seems very hot right now, even for fully remote positions. Your mileage may vary. [Sankey diagram](https://imgur.com/gallery/UT7WYyL). Quick facts about my job hunt below:

* Time from first application to offer accepted: 4 weeks
* Total applications/recruiter-provided leads: 87
   * 67 (77%) were applications I submitted
   * 20 (23%) were recruiters that contacted me
* Positions I went through the interview process for: 9
   * 6 (67%) were from recruiter-provided leads
   * 3 (33%) were from applications I submitted
* Offers extended: 3
   * Accepted offer: $130k long term W2 contract. Great benefits for a contract.
   * I suspect I would have gotten more offers but I canceled a few interviews after accepting this offer. This was the best option of the positions I had in process.
* I exclusively applied to fully remote positions in the $90k-$130k range
* I am located in the US, I can't speak to other countries

Saw a post recently about how hard it is to find a job in this field right now but my own recent experience was very different from that of the OP. I kept a spreadsheet of all my applications from a recent job hunt so I figured I would share my own experience along with some light stats/diagram. I just don't want anyone getting discouraged because the market is definitely still hot if you're looking in the right places and being smart about your application process.

Some background about me: I have about 6 years in network engineering with somewhat of a focus in a couple popular security appliances. The only certs I have are CCNA and Security+. In early May I left a very toxic/crazy job that I was burnt out from. It was a pretty dumb move as I did not have anything lined up but I was just sick of it. I don't recommend leaving your current position until you have an official start date and have cleared background checks, etc. at your new position.

What I found from the application process was that recruiters are far more useful than randomly submitting applications. Recruiters made up less than 1/4 of my total job leads but 2/3 of the interviews I got. I had more than one recruiter submit me for multiple roles that they were working. The first thing I'd recommend doing if you're searching for a job is updating your LinkedIn/Indeed/Dice/whatever job site profiles to add your job experience and relevant skills at a minimum. Make it as easy as possible for recruiters to find your profile, see your experience, and contact you. Odds are you'll get hit up with several emails/LinkedIn messages from them per week.

My experience from the interviews I did was that many places were desperate for people, especially if you're willing to work on a contract (almost all roles I interviewed for were W2 contracts). 2 of the 3 offers I received were given after only 1 interview, not including initial call with the recruiters. One didn't even have a technical portion of the interview. Honestly, I'd stay away from positions that give you an offer with minimal interviews. My previous job that I left had a single, easy interview with just the hiring manager. That ended up being because they were desperate to fill seats due to high turnover. The 2 offers I passed on also seemed like they were just desperate to fill seats in high stress environments. I'd view any offer that comes after a single, easy interview as a red flag.

Expanding off that, use the interviews to ask as many questions as you can about the role. Make sure that you have a chance to speak to actual members of the team you're joining, not just the hiring manager. Ask about what their day to day looks like and whether or not they like the organization. Team culture is more important than overall company culture in my opinion. I've worked on a great team in a bad organization as well as a bad team in a highly rated organization. Interview them as much as they interview you.

e3m660,networking,1575066525.0,"One of the coolest parts of SD-WAN is that it constantly monitors the health of our point-to-point tunnels including loss, latency, jitter, out of order packet percent, and MOS.

This is awesome because at the click of a button we can see a branch office is experiencing 30% packet loss outbound or having unacceptable jitter, etc.  And it’s displayed in cool graphs and charts that are also easy for management to digest.

The problem is none of our ISPs ever believe a shred of it.  It gets almost comically bad at times because like clock work as soon as we mentioned the SD-WAN they immediately get argumentative.

One example, our SD-WAN starts showing consistent packet loss in excess of 30% between a single branch office and our data center, in only one direction.  Both locations have DIA Fiber from the same provider, in the same city.  Pretty clear indication that something is wrong right?

We’re asked to provide some evidence of the problem we’re experiencing and we put a picture of the little graph in our SD-WAN orchestrator showing consistent one way packet loss between these two sites.  Immediately: “nuh uh that’s wrong.  That doesn’t mean anything.”  It’s like as soon as SD-WAN is even mentioned they immediately shut down and get unhelpful.  At one point we were even told “we’re an ISP we don’t drop packets.”  And they try to tell us the circuit passed a test so that proves the problem isn’t them.  We tell them no, that circuit is talking to 100 other sites with under 1% loss, the problem is only when these two sites talk directly to each other.  We even run trace routes and reverse lookups and tell them “Look at Router AGG-RTR-XXX01.”  They assure us “No, that’s impossible the problem is on your end and that’s that.  Please open a ticket with your SD-WAN vendor.”

Fast forward like a month later and the loss magically disappears and the ticket gets stealth closed with no updates.  Yeah sure they definitely didn’t find something on their end and fix it. *rollseyes*

In other case a bigger problem showed many down tunnels and huge loss all over the place and after investigation it looks like every problem is when a specific ISP A is trying to talk to a specific ISP B.  We take our findings to the provider and same old story “you might want to call your SD-WAN vendor, because we don’t have anything like that going on.”  Fast forward multiple escalation later and magically our ticket was linked to another Master Ticket and they’re bouncing ports and cleaning fiber at some NNI, and all the sudden everything goes back to normal after they resolve the Master Ticket.

I wonder why it is met with so much skepticism despite being battle tested?? I mean a lot of these ISPs are offering their own SD-WAN solutions too as a managed service, so they must believe in them?

Anyway my advice to anyone on here doing SD-WAN that has to bring up a ticket with a provider: Don’t mention SD-WAN as soon as you do they will stop taking you seriously.  If you can, re-create the issue with other traditional tools and present that to them instead.

Ok I’m done ranting for now!

1.)  I'm the only networking person on the team/whole company

Or

2.)  I'm the most knowledgeable in the shop, and everyone's go to for simple problems/reminding people of the same commands for the 3rd-4th time in a row.

I had a coworker ask me other day ""how do you know all this?""  My response was ""I read books and watched videos.""

His response was ""psh, no thanks, I have a life.""

I tried explaining to him if he ever wanted to get better at all this and work his way up, he'd need to invest some amount of time and energy studying and learning outside of work hours, to which he just kept rolling his eyes.

Sometimes I question if I'm doing my career any favors not having a mentor.  Do you think it'd be worth trying to go somewhere where I'd be the dumbest person in the room with the most to learn?  Somewhere like a large MSP or ISP, or VAR.  And how easy is it to jump from enterprise to that realm?

I do currently have ""architect"" in my job title where I work now, and make a really good salary (to the point I'd have to take a pay cut to go anywhere) but I kind of crave working with people who actually care about networking and improving their skills and staying current.  Somewhere where they all have an alphabet soup full of certs and knowledge and I'd be one of the dumbest people in the room.

5fr3bg,networking,1480529172.0,"Hey All,

I'm working to compile a list of relatively easy to check for TCP/IP configuration issues that can lead to decreased performance. I'm going to put the list below, but was hoping maybe you all could contribute as well! Doesn't necessarily have to be related to TCP/IP and could be anything else within the world of networking! 

* MSS lower than 1460. This can lead to an increase in overhead, which leads to a decrease in throughput. http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/maximum-segment-size

* TCP Window Scaling Disabled. By default TCP has a 64KB buffer built into it. What this means is that by default, a sender will transmit 64KB worth of data and then stop until it begins to receive Acknowledgments back from the receiving side. This can become a huge issue on high latency networks as it takes longer for those ACKs to come back and thus means that the sender has to stop transmitting for greater periods of time. TCP Window Scaling allows TCP to scale this before beyond 64KB to a maximum of 1GB. Here's some real world metrics. Let's say you've got a web server that's 240ms away from you and you're trying to download a file. Without TCP Window Scaling, so using the default Window size of 64KB, you can only achieve a maximum throughput of 2.18Mbit/sec. So you could be paying for 100Mbit internet, but you'll never be able to fully utilize it. Conversely, let's say we enable TCP Window Scaling and our web server supports a Shift Count of 8 (maximum Window of 16MB), we can achieve a maximum throughput of 559.24Mbit/sec. Thus allowing us to use our 100Mbit connection!
http://packetlife.net/blog/2010/aug/4/tcp-windows-and-window-scaling/
* SACK (Selective Acknowledgment) disabled. SACK is an option of TCP designed to help reduce the amount of data that needs to be re-transmitted. You can read more on this here: http://packetlife.net/blog/2010/jun/17/tcp-selective-acknowledgments-sack/
* Path MTU - Used to discover the MTU value along a path in order to avoid fragmentation. http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/aug/18/path-mtu-discovery/  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1191

This is just a quick list I put together, but they're all SUPER easy things to check for and make a world of difference in regards to network performance!

I hope this helps and please give me any feedback or suggestions! Also, I apologize if this doesn't exactly belong here as this is obviously more focused on the transport layer, but I often find issues with these settings derive from misconfigured proxies or firewalls. I also want to apologize if anything of this seems.. basic. I originally wrote this up for /r/sysadmin, but decided I should probably post something over here as well.

I work for a school district that is also involved with community internet service. Because of this, we have had 3 separate public /24 IPv4 address blocks since about 1995.    
   
Every time we contact our ISP for something, they ask for a /24 back. We could probably do this if we took some time to restructure everything and moved all our services to the other two /24s. I know we should be good ""internet citizens"" and just give the address space back, and I hate to sound like an asshole, but if we give these addresses up our chances of ever getting another contiguous block on our budget is 0. They want the space back because the addresses are now valuable.   
   
So, if we do decide to gives the ISP one /24 block back, are they worth anything? Should we ask for something in return from our ISP?

That was about three months ago. Since then we’ve done five more deployments. An app server with the unifi control software and four or five ACPro or AC LrS

In every test were able to come up with we are able to get better stats, better control, and amazing better reliability from these access points than some of the competition. 

Yet, aside from paid phone support and an SLA, I can’t think why we wouldn’t use these? Hell they’ve cheap enough that we just keep a bunch in stock and if one fails, which hasn’t happened, we just mail one down or swap it out. 

It’s easy. It’s too easy. Yet I can’t think for the life of me what I’m missing out on with the 100 dollar ACPro LRS and the appserver that I would get from ruckus cloud. 

I’ve got radius deployed. Captive portals, we’ve even got those finicky bastard scan guns warehouses use and they’ve been flawless. 

What am I missing? The cost savings are so significant that we’re less and less worried about the SLA. And I just can’t help but feel like something is up. 

Obviously, I’d never deploy these without enterprise backing for some of our medical clients. But other than that I can’t think why we wouldn’t use these elsewhere?

I feel like I’m missing something. Something big. That I’m just too green around the edges when it comes to networking that I’m missing something obvious. But please help me out. Educate me. Why should I not be buying these things? Even the most expensive 349 dollar Ap has beam-forming (at least, it claims to)

It's clearly not ready for prime time or enterprise grade and I'm ultimately going to end up spending more time fixing issues or working around them in anything other than a basic small office scenario than it would if I just bought the actual enterprise gear.

Ok, longtime lurker here.  Have some background:

I am in my early 30's and have been at my current job as a Network Admin for almost 2 years now.  I got this job during my last semester of community college when I was working on finishing a Network Tech degree and a Programming Tech degree.  Prior to my enrollment in community college, I worked as a music teacher and musician for many years.  I studied music during my attempt at a bachelor degree in the mid 2000's.  Throughout my life, I have always been interested in technology, web dev, programming, and networking to a lesser degree.  I'm sharing this to let you know that I am new to the field but have always been an enthusiast.

&#x200B;

To the meat of this post:

I was hired to fill a Network Admin role in a \~400 employee company with the understanding that I am very new to the IT professional world and would finish my CC degrees (I did btw, woot!) .  As staff has turned-over since I began working here, my responsibilities have grown from networking/help desk to include administering the company websites, implementing a huge Service Desk Application (Ivanti/HEAT), and implementing a huge document management system (OnBase).

&#x200B;

Folks, I am overwhelmed.  Honestly, just the Network side of things involving maintenance, upgrades, implementing SD-WAN & WAN-OP, interfacing with our VOIP provider, automating fail-over, office remodels, company acquisition, etc. is enough to keep me more than busy.  I'm overseeing the move/make-over of our websites from a crappy provider to a VPS setup, setting up dev environments to properly test content changes and upgrades, and troubleshooting issues with it as they arise.  I am also stuck in Help Desk hell with password resets, answering calls about setting up email on smart phones, and the like.  To top it all off, I made the mistake of staying awake during a training meeting and was tasked with taking over the document management software implementation for the whole company.  The list seems to go on forever when I think about the upcoming EOL for my network gear and VOIP contracts (never ever going to work with our current VOIP provider after this contract, so migrating to a new one in a year or two).

&#x200B;

I'm not only here to complain though, I am also looking for advice.  I am drowning in a sea of stress, and I just can't imagine that everyone hired as a Network Admin branches out into so many different and varied roles in a company.  Am I being taken advantage of?  I don't make more than $40k annually, yet I feel like I have a big role or at least a hand in almost everything going on around here (with 8 other IT employees).  Even if I made double that, I don't know if it would be worth it.

&#x200B;

Should I be looking for another job with a more narrow scope?  Am I likely to run into this same problem at another company?

You could do this by hand but that is super boring.

This script goes through a switch and figures out if the LLDP neighbors are switches, and if they are it writes the neighbor name in the interface description.

If it is an AP it just sets the description to ""WirelessAP"".  This customer has a mix of Meraki and Ubiquiti APs.  Meraki APs speak LLDP so that's easy.   The Unifi APs do NOT speak LLDP so I pull the MAC table, and do a manufacturer lookup for anything that says ""Ubiquiti"" and then I mark those ports as ""WirelessAP"".

Once all the relevant ports have useful descriptions on them, when I add them to the NMS we'll know what is actually happening on the network.

This particular customer has 150+ Procurve switches of varying vintage, and no network management.  They're all in one big VLAN on every site, it's kind of a mess but it is a fun project bringing them through the decades of network design one small iteration at a time.  I think right now they're in the 90s because we got IP addresses on all the switches, and STP enabled.  Whee!

/u/chestrulson got the answer right.  McAfee Rogue System Detection.  Our team that administers McAfee was supposed to install two sensors on every subnet.  Instead, they installed 50+ per subnet.

The symptoms I discovered through this process is that every RSD sensor would attempt a port scan of every computer on its subnet.  It would try (mostly) well-known ports.  It would do a SYN to the port, try it a couple times, and then move on to the next port.  If it got a SYN ACK, the RSD sensor immediately sent a RST to close the port.

The reason I only saw SSH traffic?  That's because on the switch, I access listed SSH traffic, with a ""deny any log"" at the end.  Nothing else was logged.  Showed up as a failed SSH attempt.

2xu24k,networking,1425419453.0,"since I haven't seen such a thing posted to reddit yet, I figured I would write up a quick review on my Pockethernet tester.

[some pics and description](http://imgur.com/a/9lHwD)

a short background, I don't test cables every day, I am a one man band for a smaller school district and have been in similar positions for most of my career, my degree is in computer network engineering but I haven't done much routing etc. for some time. so I am quite familar with most of it, yet unsure on some. I have always wanted the functions of some of the fancy fluke testers on the market but I could never justify the investment with how much they would be used. and this I believe is the devices core market. 

what is it? in function it is a bluetooth network tester, in form it is a blue flattened aluminum tube a little larger than a deck of cards adorned with little more than the pockethernet logo on the front, attractive minimalism. it has clear plexiglass style endcaps so you can see the circuit board, batteries etc. overall it feels and appears well made, nothing rattles when you shake it, and things seem nicely protected. included were a wiremap, loopback combo adapter, a short patch cable, and a micro usb cable for charging, updates etc. everything was included in the canvas case of reasonable quality.

on the clear ends you will find the controls ports, and leds. On one end you will find the rj45 port with five leds in a line (for phoneless testing and status), the other side has the single button (short press for on, little longer press for off, 10 sec for reset, double tap for flashlight), a headphone style serial port (for expansion), and its usb port (primarily for charging and firmware updates).

the app. is snappy on my s4, it opens quickly, switching screens happens quickly as well. opening the app it immediately asks to turn on bluetooth if it is off, with the tester turned on you hit the connect button, select the pockethernet you want to connect to and bam your set, it takes seconds to get ready for use, which I think is very important who wants to use it if it is slow and clunky. once pockethernet is on and the phone connected, simply plug the cable in, tap refresh on your screen and the pockethernet clicks away for a few(about 18 sec.) and lets you know what you want to know largely determined by what is connected at the other end. I will list some of the things it will do below. 

an open cable - length of cable using tdr on each pair, and that the cable is open, you can also use the tone function to tone across your choice of pairs.

the wiremap adapter - length of cable, opens, shorts, connectivity, including a wiremap (on the test and tdr screens). toneing

a loopback adapter - connecting the loopback adapter mainly allows for bit error rate tests (in the offline category) but it does show you map of the pairs.

a live cable - POE presence and voltage,link state(10, 100, 1000)duplex state, mdi/mdi-x, dhcp info if available, it also allows you to ping dns, gateway, and up to 3 ip's.

once you are done testing, you can send a report of the results straight from the report screen, this works, I haven't played with it much as I don't have much use for it.

over-all, I find the app to be laid out reasonably well, I find it easy enough to navigate and see key details you aren't needlessly switching screens or menus. and maybe more importantly... it is fast and works well. 

the hardware, appears well made, what you can see of the board looks clean and well laid out, there is nothing that rattles or screams ""I am cheap and going to break"". its design is straightforward and effective. it is designed with longevity and expansion in mind.

my playing with it the last couple days it works really well, I don't have any experience with conventional testers that have these capabilities, but I can say I haven't had any issues with this nor have I had to use the reset function. it has always done as advertised/expected.

I don't really think an enterprise or the hardcore will lay down their flukes for a pockethernet anytime soon, but for those like me, who would like a little more than a couple flashing lights but can't justify the expense, this is the tester for you.

Or maybe something like how a college student accidentally took down the 3rd largest network in Australia with a rogue dhcp server. (Was told to me by an old networking Instructure)

**The Fuck Up**

I've been troubleshooting a VPN tunnel for a new connection I'm trying to set up. As part of the troubleshooting steps, I decided to add a temporary IP address to the default tunnel access list on our main VPN router. This router is the endpoint for hundreds of VPN locations across the world.

When I added the IP address, the access list looked like this: 

    VPN-RT-01#show access-lists 100
    Extended IP access list 100
        10 permit ip [] any (3201290842 matches)
        30 permit ip [] any (596627700 matches)
        40 permit ip [] any (1160558859 matches)
        ...
        900 permit ip [**My Test IP**] any (67 matches)
    VPN-RT-01#

Then I finished my testing, and removed the entry. And got some coffee. And went to talk to a colleague. And got some more coffee. And then, exactly 30 minutes later, as the polling interval for VPN sites passed, my monitoring software lit up with hundreds of little red lights. 

A quick review of my access list showed me this:

    VPN-RT-01#show access-lists 100
    VPN-RT-01#

I'll spare you the storm that followed; thankfully, the explanations to management took far longer than the fix did. But I want to share the lesson I learned here for all the other junior network admins out there.

----
**The Lesson**

In the configuration of a Cisco router, many items show up as nested commands. For example:

    interface GigabitEthernet0
     ip address dhcp
    !

In order to edit these things, you have to enter configure mode, then configure interface mode, and then you can change it.

Access-lists, on the other hand, are not nested commands. They show up as a long list of configurations, like this:

    access-list 100 remark TUNNEL DEFAULT GATEWAY TRAFFIC 
    access-list 100 permit ip [IP Address 1] any
    access-list 100 permit ip [IP Address 2] any

This gives you the impression that you can, from global config mode, remove lines from the access list easily. This is the command I put in that started it all:

    no access-list 100 permit ip [IP Address 1] any

The router took it without any issue... and deleted the entire access list 100. Why? Because Cisco routers ignore everything after the line ""no access-list 100"". Super deceptive, and super easy to mess up. In order to actually delete just one line, such as the any any statement below, you need to do the following:

    VPN-RT-01#show access-lists 
    Extended IP access list 100
        10 permit ip [IP Address] any log (436 matches)
        20 permit ip any any
    
    VPN-RT-01#conf t
    VPN-RT-01(config)#ip access-list extended 100
    VPN-RT-01(config-ext-nacl)#no permit ip any any

Their claims of making it low-latency (25-35ms) is what interests me the most.  I wonder if they mean 25-35ms one-way, or round-trip from satellite subscriber to satellite subscriber, or if they mean satellite subscriber to servers on earth.

What is the current orbital height of satellites now that provide internet access, and what is the latency going from subscriber to satellite?  How fast does data travel through space when compared to light over fiber?

How do you envision them doing backhaul?

Thanks for the info everybody. Here is what I've gathered from all of your comments.

**Original Post**

Hey guys. I hope you can give me some feedback and criticism on an idea I'm tossing around.

The current setup:
Three buildings in the middle of the desert need internet so some scientists can submit lab results from time to time. They currently get 5Mb/second which is not enough. I've arranged to get new satellite internet out there that is 25Mb/second which will easily be what they need since their demands are so low. But my questions lie in how to get internet to all three buildings.

The buildings are each 400 feet apart. Ethernet can't handle that distance adequately, Fiber is OVERKILL for speed, cost, and also durability against the harsh desert elements is questionable (extremely hot summers, extremely cold and snowy winters). So my currently plan is this:

I feed satellite to the center building as an MDF to my main router/switch/servers/WAP etc. From that switch I use x2 media converters to go ethernet to coax, and run two lines of burial grade quad shielded RG6 in two directions to both of the side buildings. In the buildings I convert back to Ethernet and into two more WAPs. 

My questions are ... does this sound like it'll work? Haha! I haven't worked with coax nearly as much as fiber so I'm unsure if the coax will be shielded enough to not get massive amounts of interference? Do I need to bury my lines to avoid interference? Will that distance have too much data loss?  Should my coax media converters be MoCa 2.0 or if i can get by with simple DECA adapters? etc.

On paper when I look at signal loss numbers, and distance limitations it seems like it'd be... fine... but paper vs real life can be very different... and again I REALLY haven't worked with coax much.

I'm open to all ideas and criticism, but does this sound like it'll work?

***UPDATE***

Thanks everybody for your great input!

I've met with the overlords and got more info, the buildings are in a protected nature area and so they do not want to run aerial lines. They are also hesitant to dig up so much ground to connect the buildings per the same preservation reasons. Point to Point is sounding better and better for this setup.

rh65pm,networking,1639593906.0,"So,

Our company hired an employee recently, we are an ISP. This new employee says he is CCIE

I have attributed some troubleshoot work to him, he didn't do it, he didn't even troubleshooted it. One day past I have heard that the issue persisted so I troubleshooted it, it was a basic static route issue, one device was pointing the route to a nonexistent IP. I did sit beside him, asked about the issue, he blamed it was a client issue, and it was their fault, I already knew what was it so I taught him how to troubleshoot it.

He talks about MPLS but nothing deep in knowledge and other things as well. Explaining to him how our BGP work and policies, he affirms that local preference is an outbound attribute manipulation. I do inquire a lot to evaluate this new employee knowledge and all things like that and he definitely doesnt have CCIE knowledge but likes to brag about it.

Since he got in I advised him to create his own topology, but he replied that would be better create a network from start than map everything

All those things did alert me that he doesnt have the knowledge that he says he has.

Is there a way I could trace his CCIE through name?

I do believe in some point he could have a Course related to CCIE ou even the CCIE test but he definitely isnt a network expert.

Edit1: I have chatted with him today, he was TSing ipv6 prefix delegation to CPE's, I could inquire him about some network stuff, he knows some stuff. 

I do believe now that he might have taken CCIE R&S Exam some long time ago, and he did not operate most of the protocols and technology on CCIE through these years.

He is pretty agreeable guy

I will give some of my background. 

I'm working on a project that interconnects different sites through GRE Tunnel, there is a lot of devices in it. 

I got this project from 0, there was no Monitoring, documentation or conventions.

I did implement Radius Authentication, from star to spine leaf topology, GRE Tunnels run over Global BGP so spine-leaf helped to mitigated BGP Flapping, I did design topology and conventions and monitoring, there is a lot to do as well.

It is necessary similar things on ISP Network and I would love to do it, it is an interesting project to me, but I can't handle those two projects by my self.

PS I'm on GRE Project by my self and there is a lot of political interation in it

1. Can  BGP advertise routes that are learned exclusively through IGP like  redistribution from ospf or eigrp , without network statements or  aggregate network address under router BGP ? with auto summary disabled ?
2. Can BGP learn routes through local routing table on router without manually redistributing.
3. On sh ip BGP output

What is the difference between the routes  \* i , \*\>i

is \*\>i  when we specifically configure  valid internal route with AS number details using additional command ""as set ""?

say we configured network [10.2.0.0/16](https://10.2.0.0/16)   as   \*i  on ""router A"" , which has BGP peer "" router B"". on router A \-  sh ip bgp output , there is no AS path information next to network  10.2.0.0/16.

Turns out, when trunking a 3560 to a 4500, the 'switchport nonegotiate' command is required for lacp...    
duly noted.        
    
::::    
Basically, I'm getting ready to deploy 2 new 2960X's to replace a 3560 because it is at capacity.

I was preparing my template by copying the current config, when I noticed one trunk (Gi0/49) had the 'nonegotiate' command entered, and that the other Trunk (Gi0/50) did not have this command, furthermore the interface Gi0/50 was showing in a 'suspended' state in 'sh int status'
So from here, my tiny undeveloped brain incorrectly made the assumption that the 'nonegotiate' command broke the lacp link, causing it to suspend.
I was wrong.

After scrambling to the production floor (thankfully I added console port drops to the floor, as our cabinets are about 30ft) off the ground) to fix this giant catastrophe (production attached to that switch screeches to a halt), I allowed my boss to educate me on what I did wrong.

My understanding, is that the way a 3560 and a 2960 handles port channels is completely different, (3560's do not support channel mode active) and that it turns out the Trunk port that was missing the 'nonegotiate' command actually needed to have it added, instead of removing the command from the opposite port.

I can elaborate more as I research this for my own knowledge. Sorry if this was rookie post, I just like to share my fails in order to open the communication lines to further my learning.

Thanks for reading, and possibly laughing :)    
    
edit: for relevant thread content for perspective    
 :::: ::::    
So does anyone have a solid theory as to why when I removed the 'nonegotiate' command from a Trunk, the entire port channel went down?

We recently implemented a Ruckus WiFi solution in our warehouse for new wireless bar code scanners to be used for inventory etc.  

We put the WiFi network on a DMZ outside our firewall with no Internet access.  

I setup a single TCP port from the DMZ to the internal server using an encrypted protocol.  The protocol used is encrypted and uses Windows Authentication as well as authentication for the application itself.

I setup MAC Address control so only the MAC Addresses of the scanners can connect to the WiFi

The SSID is hidden, the password is strong.

We are discussing requiring a certificate to connect.

And yet, our VP insists that we mess with the power on the APs to guarantee there is no signal outside of our walls.  Of course, we still need strong signal inside the walls.  We even turned off 2.4GHz to reduce the bleed-through.

I have made my arguments clear to my Manager and my Director, that we can rely on the security in the system to keep people out, and they agree with me.  However every time they meet with the VP they are unable to convince him.

I have been with the company much longer than either my Manager or Director and I feel strongly enough about this that I have no problem going directly to the VP, but I want to go armed with as much ammo as possible.  Anyone else been in a similar situation?  

Or, does anyone agree with my VP?  Am I being to naive about the security of WiFi?",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4gkpnm/advice_on_convincing_management_that_its_not_1998/,"Advice on convincing management that it's not 1998, and WiFi isn't a gaping security hole?",,138,129,0.94

Hello, everyone!

Digitization and the transition to a community driven customer support model are forcing the worlds of IT and online forums to blend together. In the digital economy, support is critical. Combining real-time support and intelligence at the network, security and application layers is transformational for companies. It can provide them with insight into the state of their business and, most importantly, into the quality of their support experiences. To drive this transformation, we are excited to announce Cisco’s intent to acquire /r/networking, a leading online support forum!

As companies across industries are expanding their digital infrastructure, IT departments are faced with vast amounts of complex support cases. /r/networking helps many of the world’s largest enterprises translate these challenges into business successes and empowers them to drive value for their customers in today’s digital world.

Together with Cisco’s industry leading digital network architecture, customers will now have unprecedented access to support, from infrastructure to application. With this level of support, companies will be equipped to improve customer experiences and accelerate revenue opportunities. The acquisition of /r/networking also supports Cisco’s strategic transition toward customer-centric solutions that deliver predictable recurring revenue.

The /r/networking acquisition is expected to close in Cisco’s third quarter of fiscal year 2017. /r/networking will continue to be led by the fantastic mod team: 

 - /u/ugnaught
 - /u/Mikecom32
 - /u/BridgeBum

which will be a new support center under Joe Cozzolino, Senior Vice President, Services. We look forward to welcoming the /r/networking community to Cisco.

gf6w1h,networking,1588859389.0,"Cisco Firepower 2130 w/ASA code and Microsoft Windows 10 VPN client (Always On) using IKEv2 w/AES-128 with Machine certificate authentication.

Draft: #1

Hopefully this will help out anyone trying to get MS Windows 10 (always on) VPN working with ASA.  I was having some issues online trying to find out more information on how to set this up.  I got it working in my environment so figured I would try to share something I learned.

&#x200B;

But Motavar why? Questions:

\- Why Cisco ASA and not a MS VPN /RAS box.  Unfortunately spinning up another set of VPN services results in additional systems to support. From servers, to network route changes, firewall changes,  to border security, to ownership, documentation, everything.  Sometimes it may be easier to point new VPN clients to an existing VPN headend (Cisco ASA) which is already setup.

\- Why MS VPN Client.  ""Some People"" wanted to move to Always on VPN over AnyConnect. Not my call..

&#x200B;

Please Note:

\- This documentation assumes your Cisco Firepower 2130 ASA is running 9.13.x code to support Appliance mode. I'm not going to go into details on how to do this..

\- We are also assuming that under your ""AnyConnect Connection Profiles"" section you enabled ""Allow user to select connection profile on the login page"" is checked and you're using a custom connection profile for AnyConnect users.

NOTE: This is important since a custom profile for AnyConnect will make sure your users are not using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for connetions.

NOTE2: 3rd party VPN clients such as the MS Windows 10 VPN client will be using the ""DefaultRAGroup"" for the connection. You have to make sure no other IPSec/AnyConnect clients will be connecting to this group.  We are going to modify this for MS clients use only.

\- We are assuming you rolled out Machine certs from a local CA. Also make sure your machine certs have a subject name field or else the connection will fail as the ASA uses the SN for tracking who connected.  Without a Subject field you won't be able to connect.

\- We are assuming you are using MS VPN Client for Windows 10 that supports IKEv2 w/PFS

\- We are assuming most work is done in ASDM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lets Begin!

&#x200B;

NOTE: Some timers/settings may vary on your particular setup. So make changes as needed for your org. This is only a helpful framework to get you closer to getting your MS clients to connect.  You know your environment so the changes you make and what you break... is on YOU.

&#x200B;

Create a Group Policy:

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Group Policies""

&#x200B;

\* In this example we are creating a Group Policy called ""AOVPN"" for Always On VPN.

So create group policy ""AOVPN"".

Inside of the policy setup set your max connection time to ""unlimited"" and Idle timeout to ""30 Minutes""

&#x200B;

\* Setup your DNS, scopes, etc

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is required for PFS use: Failure to do this step will result in the VPN client failing to pass traffic after re-key event. The default MS VPN client IPSEC Child SA settings are 3600 seconds and /250000k.

&#x200B;

\* Go to Advanced section and down to IPSec(IKEV1) client.  Enable PFS (perfect forward secrecy"". While this is listed under the IKEv1 section it's actually used in the IKEv2 settings.  Yah, Go Cisco!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Setup your IKEv2 Policies and IPSec Proposals

\------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""IKE Policies"".

&#x200B;

\* Under IKEv2 Policies create an Entry as follows:

DH Group 14, Encryption AES, Integrity Hash ""sha256"" and Pseudo Random Function PRF hash ""sha256"" and lifetime 86400 seconds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\* Setup your IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets).

Go down a menu item to ""IPsec Proposals (Transform Sets).""

Under IKE V2 IPsec Proposals:

create an entry with AES and Integrity Hash ""sha-256""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Apply the IPSec Proposals to your Crypto Maps

\-----------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""Advanced"".  Then down to ""IPSec"" tree item and down to ""Crypto Maps"".

&#x200B;

NOTE: This is important because while we created the IKEv2 settings they are not added to the dynamic crypto map for some reason..

&#x200B;

\* Find your ""Dynamic: 65535.x"" dynamic map for outside/inside and edit it:

Under the ""Tunnel Policy (crypto map) - Basic"" tab find the ""ike v2 ipsec proposal"" section and add in ""AES-128/sha-256"" IKEv2 proposal we created above.

&#x200B;

\* Put a check mark next to ""Perfect Forwarding Secrecy "" and select Diffie-Hellman Group:  Group 14

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Install your CA Certificate for Machine cert auth:

\--------------

\* From your Internal CA create a cert and install that onto the ASA

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""Identity Certificates"". Pop in your cert and/or go up to CA certs and add it there.  This is used for the machine cert authentication.

\* Name the Associated Trustpoint something like ""VPNMachineCert""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Setup the IPSec(IKEv2) Connection Profiles

\-------------------------

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to IPSec (IKEv2) Connection Profiles"".

&#x200B;

\* Find ""DefaultRAGroup"" and check the box under ""IKEv2 Enabled"".

&#x200B;

Edit the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and perform the following:

&#x200B;

\-Check box next to ""Enable Certificate Authentication"" under the IKE Peer Authentication section

&#x200B;

\-Check Box next to ""Enable RSA signature Hash"" under the RSA signature section. NOTE: This is used when AES is enabled in the MS VPN Client. If using default settings in the MS Client I believe this may not be used.

&#x200B;

\- In the IKE Local Authentication section: Check the box ""Enable local authentication"" and select ""Certificate"".  In the dropdown box select the cert we want to use.. the trustpoint name would be ""VPNMachineCert"" or whatever you called it.

&#x200B;

\- User Authentication section server group would be LOCAL

\- Setup your DHCP stuff..

\- Default Group Policy:  Select the group policy ""AOVPN"" that we created earlier. Make sure ""Enable IKEv2 Protocol"" is checked below that item.

&#x200B;

\- On the left menu tree go into the ""Advanced"" section and down to ""Authorization"". Under authorization section select ""use the entire DN as the username"".

&#x200B;

I believe no other settings are required so okay and exit out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Enable Interfaces for IKEv2

\--------------------

&#x200B;

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Network Client Access"" at the top tree menu and down to ""AnyConnect Connetion Profiles"".

&#x200B;

\* Make sure ""IPSec (IKEv2) Access is enabled on your inside/outside intefaces. So check mark ""allow access"" and ""enable client services"".

&#x200B;

\* Find the ""DefaultRAGroup"" and edit it.  Confirm the following:

Authentication AAA/Local group

Confirm client address pools

Confirm the group policy is still ""Aovpn""

confirm ""enable IPSEC(ikev2) client protocol is checked and DNS/Domain info is in there.

&#x200B;

NOTE: Most likely all this was already configured under the IKEV2 settinsg from before but doesn't hurt to check it here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client.

\---------------

&#x200B;

\* Windows 10 - in your search bar type ""VPN"" and bring up the VPN settings.

\* Create a VPN connection

VPN Provider: Windows (Built-in)

Connection name ""VPN""

server: your ASA outside IP /DNS name

VPN Type: IKEv2

Type of sign-in info:  certificate

check box next to rememebr my sign-in info.

Save that

&#x200B;

\* Go into your Windows 10 settings section and find ""Network & Internet""

Select ""change adapter options""

Find your VPN adapter and right-click it:

go to properties and over to the ""Security"" tab:

under the ""Data Encryption"" section move the check box to ""use machine certificates"".

Okay out and save that

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Final steps...

&#x200B;

Now we have to harden/change the VPN setup to use AES..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MS Windows 10 VPN client (harden)

\------------------

\* Command prompt /admin time..   so launch a command prompt

\* Launch powershell

\* Enter the following:

$connection = ""VPN""

Set-VpnConnectionIPsecConfiguration -ConnectionName $connection -AuthenticationTransformConstants SHA256128 -CipherTransformConstants AES128 -DHGroup Group14 -EncryptionMethod AES128 -IntegrityCheckMethod SHA256 -PFSgroup PFS2048 -Force

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Launch the VPN client:

\------------------

Click your windows network icon in the lower right and launch the VPN client and connect.  Debug whatever you need to do on the ASA to confirm working.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

AFTER TESTING CONNECTIVITY NOW ITS TIME FOR REVOCATION:

We save this for last since revocation can be a pita to test.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Setup Certificate Revocation

\-------------------------

\* Back into ASDM

\* In the ASDM go to the ""remote access VPN"" lower left menu then up to ""Certificate Management"""" at the top tree menu and down to ""CA Certificates"".

\* Find the Trust point for the Machine certs.. something like ""VPNMachineCert""

\* Edit the Trust Point:

under ""revocation check"" table enable ""Check certificates for revocation"".

Move CRL over to the right side.

&#x200B;

\* Under the ""CRL retrieval policy""

Check box ""use CRL distribution point from the certificate""

&#x200B;

\* Under the CRL retrieval method""

Disable LDAP

Enable HTTP

&#x200B;

\* Under the ""advanced"" tab:

update your cache timers.  Mine is 60 mines

check box ""enforce next crl update""

other options:

I have accept certs issued by this CA

Accept certs from the subordinate CAs of this CA

leave CRL check none: (we'll fix this)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And finally... to work around ADSM bug with Enabling the CRL check

\-----------------

\* SSH to your VPN gateway and enable yourself

\* Config T

&#x200B;

Enter into your trust point (example)

&#x200B;

type:  crypto ca trustpoint VPNUSER\_CA

type:  revocation-check crl

type:  crl configure

type:  no protocol ldap

&#x200B;

Note: most likely no protocol ldap was already enabled but .. meh.. you have it again :)

&#x200B;

NOTE2: Perform the steps above for any TrustPoints that have -1 or -2 or whatever else was created.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Revocation Time

\------------

Have your server friends put your machine cert on hold.

Then have them push out the revocation to sub ca's

Then go into ASDM trust point and retrieve CRLS and confirm your client is blocked.

&#x200B;

Then unrevoke, push out changes on server, retrieve CRLS on the ASA and test you can re-connect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When Revocation/or un-revoke doesnt work:

\------------------

When in doubt do the following:

Have the server team push out revocation changes to the Sub CAs or whatever they do (again).

Go into ASDM and over to the ""Monitoring"" tab at the top and down to ""properties"" in the lower left corner.

In the Tree menu find ""CRL"" and go into that section.

View ALL CRLs...

Delete /clear all CRLS

Go back to your trust point and update CRLs.

Test again after a minute.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well.. I hope this helped someone?

I wish you all luck if you're crazy enough to do this..

And as always, stay safe out there and wear a mask :)

&#x200B;

UPDATE: 6/16/2020:

I suggest moving to [9.14.1.10](https://9.14.1.10) code for your ASA to resolve Login bugs with AnyConnect clients.

Also.. we noticed some type of uauth issues. We're assuming its related to the ASA not really knowing that AlwaysOnVPN users exist. So we're seeing the gateway re-assign DHCP addresses to AnyConnect users that may already be in use with AoVPN users.  So I would suggest splitting your DHCP pool up between AoVPN user and a different pool for AnyConnect to avoid these issues. 

This may be noticed with debug pix uauth on the gateway.

I don't want to be too specific because I half way would rather not get doxxed with this username, but today I came across a Loopback with a public IP, and then a private IP addressed interface referenced it.

Something I thought I might be doing often would be looking at pcaps and the like. Most if not all the time I have not needed to do this - generally boils down to layer 1-3 issues a physical issue or config issue. I find myself being at the level 1 support analyst never doing it. Pretty much it gets fixed without a packet capture or goes to a higher level analyst/team which I never see again as more tickets and calls come in.

I ask in part because where I work they use netscout and observer. Along with wireshark.

I am just left scratching my head a bit wondering if capturing and analyzing packets is more a niche skill then? Is learning how to read deeply into a pcap worthwhile or should I put my time and effort into say the CCNP or scripting for example?

Personally I think its freakin cool, one of my favorite things in packet tracer was turning on the option to see how packets were being sent over network - seeing DHCP, STP, ARP, and all these packets just working over (or not working lol) the network its crazy to think about.

We are located in the NYC area, and are a Verizon customer.

&#x200B;

Back story, Wednesday night we started getting alerts our sites (They sit behind Akamai Site Shield) were failing to be polled from our main DataCenter (Pretty much any other website on the internet was working). After a few hours of troubleshooting internally, we got out System Operation and Monitoring team to setup NetPath monitoring. Doing a NetPath to the Akamai Edge Key our DNS was resolving to, we noticed traffic dying out in Miami AT&T.

Looking at Verizon BGP looking glass in New York for our Akamai End point, the ASN path was Verizon -> AT&T -> Akamai EU -> Akamai US. On our edge Verizon edge router, I cleared BGP neighbors and shut down our interface, all traffic failed over to our secondary circuit and everything started reporting as healthy.  Looking at NetPath traffic was now going Sungard -> Level3 -> Akamai EU -> Akamai US. I pretty much told everyone on the MIR (Manager Incident Response) call we lucked out, that our backup internet connection had a BGP peering other then AT&T, if it didn't the failover would of fixed nothing.

They then asked why polling was working out of our Campus DC. I explain we are running ECMP with Verizon and LightTower with IP SRC /DST hashing. The Solarwinds Poller running NetPath in our Campus happened to be taking LightTower, so it was reporting as up. Once everything reported as up in our main DataCenter, I was asked which of our Customers were effected. My response was it depends. For me as a Comcast customer looking at Comcast's BGP looking glass they have a direct peering with Akamai, I would of been fine as a customer. A customer with Verizon FIOS, would of taken the same path through the bad AT&T segment (If their DNS resolved to the same Akamai Edge Key that ours was).

I was then asked how do we make this no occur again, I said we could get more diverse carriers, but with out knowing all up stream BGP peerings for every destination on the internet it a roll of the dice. I just replied we could buy every carrier located in the US :-D

Wondering how some of you guys would handle this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Update

This is what I came up with for fix (bandaids).  If DataCenter Solarwinds Poller reports a site as down, but another poller reports it up. It will kick off a SAM script passing the fqdn that is down. ([https://github.com/SyrusHCW/Troubleshooting/blob/master/nslookup-200.py](https://github.com/SyrusHCW/Troubleshooting/blob/master/nslookup-200.py))

This will go out and do an nslookup against several DNS servers (currently hard coded) then using the learned values it will try to connect to each, until it gets a 200. Once it gets a 200, it will spit out an array.

{'hostname': 'www', 'dns zone': 'example.com', 'ipv4': '[93.184.216.34](https://93.184.216.34)'}

From these returned value it will  run the following powershell script ([https://github.com/SyrusHCW/Troubleshooting/blob/master/windows-dns.ps1](https://github.com/SyrusHCW/Troubleshooting/blob/master/windows-dns.ps1))

It will connect to 2012R2 and newer host, and create an A record to a reachable IP address. Once this is done it will log into other DC's (2008R2) and do a zone refresh. It will then log into all the Web front end boxes, and flushdns, this should then force a new lookup which will resolved to a reachable edgekey.

I will probably have the web front ends read in from Palo Alto Panorama, as we tag all our servers. In this case it will return WFE that  match the tags NYC and WFE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/goijtk/how_do_you_explain_upstream_carrier_issues_to/,How do you explain upstream carrier issues to management?,,134,74,0.95

I've confirmed that the TCP keep alive messages are not making it to my server by running packet captures on the server at the same time as I generate them from my laptop, I've also verified that my test server is capable of receiving TCP keep alive packets by sending them from a virtual private server on a completely different network.

I hear things like:

* My home internet is simpler
* I want all the passwords, so I can fix it myself.
* Who would want to hack us?
* Our data isn't that critical, we don't need backups.

Things we've done:

* WPA2 Enterprise - they have a lot of casual volunteer staff, and even full-time staff changes a fair bit, so this helps us avoid having to rotate keys (although I think they never bothered to before).
* Separate VLANs/VRFs for the two tenants, as well as VoIP traffic, and also audio/video traffic
* 802.1x for port access control and a NAC (PacketFence) - they rent out the space to other people/groups, and often have visitors in the building.
* Layer 7 QoS - We recently upgraded them from 5Mbps/5Mbps to 100Mbps/40Mpbs - however, staff still complain about speed or ""general internet issues"". I suspect some of this is related to cloud storage (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive etc.) For example - one staff member backed up 50GB of video in 2 hours but didn't realise. (I should probably implement fq\_codel or something).
* Suricata as a IDS - not sure how to explain this in layman's terms.

Things I'm still getting a handle on:

* They use VoIP telephony, and complain about call dropouts.
* One of the tenants processes credit-card information, so we try to segregate their traffic. They're not strictly PCI-compliant - but they say their bank has never asked them to agree to be PCI complaint.
* Their CRM/accounting software transmits everything in clear-text, so I'm routing that traffic over ZeroTier (as a VPN).
* Their server room is a small storage closet - they use a telco rack, so some of the servers are stacked on top of it, rather than in it. And there's no cooling in that room - heat is trapped in there, I used a FLIR and it's around 40 degrees Celcius in there. I don't know how to get them to install cooling.
* Setup FreeNAS to provide some kind of backup (e.g. for video data).
* They have no redundant power, or surge protection for the server/network room. One tenant is mostly cloud-based, whilst the other runs on-premise software.

7qdloz,networking,1515954763.0,"# eNMS - first release

I spent the past few weeks working on eNMS, a vendor-agnostic NMS designed for network visualization and, more importantly, network automation.
I've just published a first release yesterday that you can find on [Github](https://github.com/afourmy/eNMS).



You can find a description of the main features in the readme, I made some video to make it as clear as possible what you can do with it.

I also hosted a demo version on pythonanywhere, which you can find at the following link:

http://afourmy.pythonanywhere.com/
credentials: username: cisco / password: cisco

(this demo is mainly for you to see what it looks like, I disabled most functionalities.)



# Features:

In short, the main features are:

- interface to Netmiko and NAPALM to send scripts graphically to about any type of network device (or group of devices)

- possibility to use Jinja2 along with a YAML file to send a template-based script

- scheduling of the script: you can send a script to any group of devices, at any time, at any frequency (once a day, once a week, etc). When a script is sent to a group of device, it is executed in parallel with multiple processes (so it's very fast, even if you have hundreds of routers/switches).

- visualization of your network with either Open Street Map or via a force-based algorithm if you don't have the GPS coordinates

- SSH connection to a device from OpenStreetMap or the force-based visualization

- TACACS+ authentication

- Dashboard showing some useful information about your network

- Advanced regex-based filtering (very important and powerful: see readme for details)

- Export to Google Earth

- a few other things

If you want to find out more about the project, I suggest you read the readme on github.



# History of the project:

It all started during the NAPALM hackathon end of november, when I created a first version that I called ""eNAPALM"". After a while, I decided to change a lot of things and it wasn't entirely focused on NAPALM anymore, so I renamed it eNMS.
So the project is about 6-7 weeks old and there definitely is some testing / debugging to do (if you find a bug (there should be plenty), you can create an issue on github and I'll do my best to fix it).
I reimplemented many features that I had already implemented about a year ago in pyNMS (https://github.com/afourmy/pyNMS), a similar project in pyQt.



# Technical stack:

Back-end: 

- Python (Flask)

- APScheduler (job scheduling)

- NAPALM / Netmiko / Jinja2 / YAML (network automation)

- SQLAlchemy (SQLite for now but I will switch to PostgreSQL soon)

Front-end:

- Bootstrap

- Javascript (leaflet, vis, jquery, etc.)

See the ""Credits"" section of the readme for more information.

For the front-end, I used a Bootstrap template called ""Gentelella"" (https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella). When I started, there was no integration of Gentelella with Flask (only Django) so as a pre-requisite of eNMS, I had to do that. I thought it might be interesting for other devs, so I made it a standalone project. If you want to develop some Flask interface, this can be a good place to start, kinda like a Flask boilerplate:
https://github.com/afourmy/flask-gentelella



# Contributions:

Contributions are most welcome !
This could be improving the code, adding some features (see the issues for a list of things that would be nice to have), creating some documentation (the readme is pretty much all there is right now), creating files for the containerization (I made a /docker folder to host some dockerfiles for example), and commiting some useful templates that you use. 

For the templates, I made a /script folder where I show some examples of Jinja2 templates + the YAML file that goes with it. If you have such j2 template (any platform / OS), and you're willing to share, that would be awesome. (the ""structure"" would be /script/vendor-name/os-name/the-files-here)

I have been given the greenlight to start the automation journey for our current organization and go from zero network automation to hero. It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.

There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn't blow up in your face.

So my question to folks who have been down this journey.

* Can you describe your current workflow?
* What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?
* How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?
* Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?
* Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?
* How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? 

I'm aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.

n9noey,networking,1620703280.0,"A month ago, I posted here to ask for some help about Network Deployment ([Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/m87mp7/advice_for_first_time_network_deployment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). Being a Developer, Network deployment is not my strongest skill. But after going through it myself, and with tremendous help from various people (Data Electricians and IT Redditors) and a lot of time researching, I was able to successfully deploy a network on a new building! I know the post was not popular if at all, but I would like to thank the redditors that provided their time and advice. :)

&#x200B;

The physical deployment took about 3 days. There was roughly 2 weeks worth of preparation which included research and ordering. Included was obviously creating VLANs and securing the network and enabling logging etc. I have not included that below as configuration will be different for each device/brand topology. 

&#x200B;

Here is quick mock-up guide for those who may find themselves in the same position as I was (hopefully never):

1.) Create a scope on what it is going to be and what it is you are going to need in order to deploy your network. How many static (approx.)? Guests (approx.)? Telephones (VoIp)? Conference Rooms (Video Streaming)? How much is the budget?

&#x200B;

2.) Before asking/going for a survey/inspection, ensure you have some tools with you. 

a. Network Cable Tester 

b. Various Screwdrivers/Phillips

c. Cable ties

d. Flash Light

e. Label Maker (or a Marker and a Painter’s Tape or both!)

f. Tape Measure

g. Ladder

h. \*\*Vacuum (only if it is an old/existing Data Cab)\*\*

i. Documentation (in writing or digital)

&#x200B;

3.) Request survey/inspection of the building and the building plan (you want to look for the electrical plan if possible). **Note:** I liaised with our OH&S who was a former Civil Engineer/Tradie/Builder. I am lucky in this regard as he took over the safety inspection for every single floor and also hired the appropriate people to fix and replace things. This included the wiring. You may need to hire a building inspector to do that part or you may not.

[Data Cabinet - Before Pics!](https://imgur.com/a/kd33qI5)

&#x200B;

4.) Begin your survey/inspection when safe to do so. Check the Data Cabinet. Clean up and replace/remove/fix things. Begin testing of every single port against the Patch Panel. Mark/label the ports and number them accordingly (if it wasn’t done so). Mark the patch panel as well to make it easier to visualize things. 

&#x200B;

5.) Roughly measure the distances of the switch to the patch panel so you can buy (or make one yourself **\[** [How To Make RJ45 Network Patch Cables - Cat 5E and Cat 6 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lullzS740wI) **\])** appropriate length of ethernet cables and also the amount you will need. 
**Note:**As per comments below, it would be better to measure to size rather than the DIY approach. 

&#x200B;

6.) Create a documentation of things from steps 4 and 5 as appropriate. 

[My documentation example](https://imgur.com/a/xQifpsm)

&#x200B;

7.) Begin creating a list of things to order. With my particular situation (for one floor in particular):

a. 2 Wireless Access Points

b. 1 Switch (48 Port)

c. 50 pcs. 1 Meter Cat6 cables (because the Patch Panel actually runs in Cat6)

d. 10 pcs. 2 meter Cat6 cables (for those that need the extra length, then cut to size)

Note: Do test your systems if they are working before working live 

&#x200B;

8.) When wiring the Data Cabinet, it is a good idea to have some visualization on how you would tackle the situation. Plan out which Ports from the Patch Panel would go. I highly suggest to keep a note as you go along so you do not lose track of which Patch Panel Port actually goes into your switch, especially if you decide not to go 1:1 (like I did). Take your time. 

[Network Deployment Complete - sort of!](https://imgur.com/a/DEmsvka)

&#x200B;

9.) Monitor your network and look at the logs. Ask your users and make changes/fixes etc. as needed. 

&#x200B;

And that is it! My experience/simple walkthrough guide for a basic network deployment!

P.S. the pictures reflect the network deployment at about 98% completion.  The end product is cleaner. Also, this is a very ""simple"" network deployment, all things considered. But I wanted to share my experience and learning from it for those who may face a similar scenario or situation.

1i7ewr,networking,1373695641.0,"I'd like to take the opportunity to perhaps talk about some of the things I've learned throughout my career that have aided me in my current, and hopefully continued success.

A little history about myself,

I am a 25 year old network professional. I started out at 18 working for a small multi-site company as part of a two-person IT department in a jack-of-all-trades role; although, my desire has always been in networking. Like a lot of you, I find great reward, you could say a high, in designing and supporting networks that meet business needs, big or small, and delivering success. Throughout my career I've had to learn many valuable lessons that I wish to share with you all.

I do not claim to be an expert in this field, in fact, I strive to work around people that are more seasoned than I, and where challenges are abundant, as that is where you will thrive and learn the most. A lot of these lessons I'm about to talk about may not even be new to you, however, I want this to be an act of giving back to a community that has given so much [knowledge].

So in proceeding, I'd like to break this down into three sections, Social, Business, and Technical Skills.

**Social**

In order to be successful, you will need to know how to interact and communicate with others effectively.

Whether you are a CEO, manager, or employee, you will at some point have to communicate with others, whether it be business, leisure, or personal matters, and if you want to be successful, regardless of industry, this is going to require strong interpersonal skills.

I grew up mostly introverted, shy, unwilling to break out of my shell no matter the situation. Over time, after much self-reflection and practice, I am beginning to come to the realization that speaking to others does not have to be a nerve-wrecking ordeal. Success, personal or business, requires the skill of expressing your thoughts and ideas, building relationships and rapport with those around you, and using communication as another tool in your arsenal. Don't be afraid to express your thoughts, but be smart about how you deliver them. Unless you are an asshole, if you are genuine and speak with conviction, people will notice and respect that. This includes speaking to your colleagues, managers, friends, family, strangers... anyone. With time, you will learn to open up, initiate conversations, adapt to different environments, and types of people.

Be patient with people, and yourself. 
Learn to respect others and be tolerant. 
Don't dwell on work related stress, these troubles will pass, as they usually do.
Don't be afraid to fail, find the confidence in yourself, because it *is* there.
Don't ever lose sight of your goals and never, ever give up on your dreams.

**Business**

Success in business begins with learning the right skills. These skills can be technical, social, business, and sometimes all three.

Technical skills get you in the door; social and business skills get you up the ladder.

Throughout my career I've noticed that aside from having technical skills, learning about the business in which you operate is key. I've learned that businesses, big or small, have objectives. Hone your technical skills and over time, if you've been challenged, you will learn what works and what does not; you will learn how to design networks based on best practices, develop processes, policies and procedures that work, and deliver services that your client will ultimately appreciate.

Learn to network with people, it won't hurt, and at best, will open up doors to new opportunities, opportunities that will hopefully test you, frustrate and break you, challenge and teach you, and build character.

**Technical**

In networking, I believe the most important lesson I've learned in becoming an effective engineer is not to just study and pass a test and claim to know enough to handle real-world situations, but to gain experience.

Technical certification exams can only teach you so much, and most of it will be forgotten if you do not utilize it in your day-to-day. I have to give credit to companies that have structured their exams around real-world situations and making the student think more about using their forces for good... if that makes sense. This means more than just memorizing commands and tidbits, it's about gaining the technical expertise and using it to empower businesses.

I believe the most important thing you need to understand in becoming a masterful network engineer are PROTOCOLS. Learn how they behave, learn how they are structured, learn how they operate INTRICATELY, learn their history! I cannot stress this enough. LEARN. PROTOCOLS. Examples include the almighty TCP/IP protocol, arguably one of the most important protocols you should know inside-out as a network engineer. Once you understand the dynamics of these logical processes, you will develop, over time, through years of sweat, blood, and tears, the ability to troubleshoot complex challenges with ease, or easier than those less knowledgeable. There are tools out there that allow you to delve as deeply as you'd like into protocol operation, tools that allow the visualization of communication between network entities at a very low level, that, if you learn to understand, will give you the upper-hand.

Learn to diagram! This is extremely important as an engineer. And I don't mean throwing together a willy-nilly diagram that no one but you can interpret. It will take time, but the more you diagram the better. Not only will it allow you to familiarize yourself with the program you use (Visio for me), you will learn what works and what doesn't. Over time, your diagrams will get better, they will be organized, structured logically, and if you're good, allow you to communicate complex ideas with simplicity. Keep a notepad with you while you work or blank paper, sketching out your thoughts when solving issues or needing to understand something complex, it makes life easier!

Learn to document! Seriously, I cannot count the amount of times I told myself I'd remember something, or said I would note it down later but never did and completely forgotten about it. Whether it be documentation for your company, or a personal knowledgebase for yourself, this will only help! Personally, I've been using Evernote to do this. It is free, robust, and accessible. Often times while solving an issue I will take the time during and afterwards to note the symptoms of the issue, steps I took to troubleshoot and their result, resolution, and resources that aided me such as website links. And trust me, if this is not done, you will encounter issues that you HAVE solved before, but so long ago that you forgot how you fixed it and even where you went to learn how to fix it; this sucks, so document and save yourself some time!

Never be afraid to leave your comfort zone. 
Learn to think outside the box.
Strive to learn something new every day! Even one thing is progress!

**Conclusion**

IT is an amazing field to get into that can be incredibly fulfilling if you are willing to put in the work. As with any field, you will most likely start at the bottom, but if you are dedicated, and truly have a passion for this, you can't go wrong. Some people will tell you networking is a dying field but that is so very, very wrong. The discipline of network engineering is a thriving one, and will be for some time. Networks are getting larger, demands for connectivity are growing, and competent, experienced professionals are always needed as long as you keep learning, earn your keep, and never lose sight of your goals.

I apologize for the rant, I just needed to get some things off my chest, if even one person learns something from this... success!

Thanks!

After consulting with both internal and outside technical experts, the root cause has been identified as a recent Apple Operating System update (version iOS 6.1) that many of us have downloaded and installed as we would routinely.   This issue is NOT unique to our company and is affecting all companies using Microsoft Exchange for mail and supporting Apple mobile devices.
 
In a nutshell, the problem is that even though you personally may not be an Apple user who accesses our email system with an iPhone or iPad, or you may not have downloaded and installed the iOS 6.1 release (like me), those Apple devices in our company that have installed the upgrade are causing havoc with our web mail servers.  There is a bug in the upgraded Operating System which prohibits Apple devices from communicating properly with Exchange, resulting in the Exchange mail servers becoming overwhelmed with redundant activity to the point that the servers can’t keep up and slow down or shut down for periods of time.
 
We, along with many other companies and technical experts (including Apple and Microsoft), are diligently working to find a solution.
 
In the meantime, recognizing that our efficiency out on the road will take a hit, we would request that Apple device users who have recently installed the upgraded iOS Version 6.1 limit their use of email services from those Apple devices as much as possible and to use web mail or VPN connections as much as possible until we can reach a resolution of this frustrating issue.

If you remember me, I posted the 230+ color schemes for MobaXterm a few weeks ago.  Recently I got to use SecureCRT and looked out for syntax highlighting, as there is no preset.  There seems to be a really popular one called ""Cisco Words"" on their forums, but I found it to be a bit too jarring with the color choices, so I decided to make an edit to change all the colors to be a bit more muted, drawing inspiration from the ""Chalkboard"" theme from the MobaXterm themes I did.

I didn't create the configuration file myself, simply made changes to the color choices and added some words.  If anybody thinks I shouldn't distribute this as it's most of it isn't my work, let me know.  I'm including a photo album of how it looks, plus the link to download the .zip file.  There's a readme inside for instructions on how to install it.

Enjoy!

I stupidly changed the admin password without specifying the privilege level on the primary switch, but did on the secondary. Now, not only did the stack break, I can't log in with exec or exec config privileges AND the virtual environment is down.

We had HA setup but for some reason since the primary went down everything did. Is there a way to get exec and conf privileges again on the primary switch? . . . Without wiping it. I'm not a network admin if you can't tell already.

hm6wno,networking,1594039241.0,"I've spent an obscene amount of time working on my project called scrapli -- a silly name that is ""scrape cli"" squished together. As the name/title implies, scrapli is a screen scraping library built in python, but theres a bit more to it than that, and as of this past weekend scrapli encompasses more than just ""screen scraping"" -- it also can handle NETCONF connections (get/get-config/edit-config/etc. -- though not 100% RFC support yet)!

**TL;DR** \- scrapli is wicked fast, has zero requirements\*, supports 100% of normal OpenSSH behavior\*, is well typed/tested/documented, sync and asyncio with the same API, and provides a consistent look/feel across telnet/SSH/NETCONF (over SSH).

\* if using ""system"" transport (you can ready about what that means in the README!)

&#x200B;

Before going too deep into things, here are some links that may be useful:

* [scrapli GitHub repo](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli)
* [scrapli GitHub community](https://github.com/scrapli)
* [A short demo with Ethan Banks on PacketPushers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hInZyX-tuIc)
* [A very long stream with Dmitry Figol on his Twitch/YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJa2typq7yI&t=1s)
* [Slightly older video I made talking through the guts of scrapli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twO0jYGQdH8&t=1s)

&#x200B;

I won't bother too much talking about what scrapli is and how its built as I've written extensively about it in the README on the GitHub page (first link above), as well as gone into tons of detail with Dmitry on his stream. Instead, I'll outline some reasons you may be interested in scrapli.

* scrapli is super fast - it supports multiple different flavors of transports depending on your needs, so speed may vary a bit from transport to transport, but scrapli is fast with any of them! If you *really* feel the need for speed the ssh2-python (wrapper around libssh2 C library) plugin is about as fast as you'll get in python!
* You care about typing! I know for me personally I really enjoy libraries with good type hinting -- its useful for IDE auto complete/Intellisense stuff, and being strict with typing can help stop problems before they rear their head (and has with scrapli!).
* You enjoy long walks on the beach and reading ridiculously long README docs.
* You want to write asyncio code. Not for everyone for sure, and I'm not advocating for asyncio necessarily, but ""right tool for the right job"" -- scrapli provides the exact same API for both sync and aysncio.
* There is a nornir plugin for scrapli -- the current version on pypi works with nornir 2.x, but an improved version is ready to be pushed whenever nornir 3.x is ""officially"" released.
* You have telnet/SSH and NETCONF devices that you interact with -- the NETCONF support is built right on top of scrapli ""core"", so you interact with scrapli in exactly the same way regardless of the type of connection you are making. Same host setup (the arguments you pass to scrapli to make a connection), same look and feel of the API, same result objects, etc.
* You appreciate possibly too many tests. I have spent a goodly portion of that obscene amount of time making sure scrapli is well tested! There are of course unit tests, but there are also ""functional"" tests that run against virtual devices (and info in the README on how you can setup a lab to match if you wanted to test scrapli or contribute to it), as well as a mocked SSH server for ensuring that even without the ""functional"" tests  scrapli can be tested in the most real way possible -- ensuring its doing what its supposed to do.
* Additional platforms can easily be added by simply defining the privilege levels and on\_open/on\_close functions. I'm also working on a scrapli\_community setup so that folks can add more device support. I am pretty adamant about not having a billion classes to maintain, and instead just having things be fairly pluggable by passing in args/callables to the ""NetworkDriver"" (or AsyncNetworkDriver of course)
* There is seeming to be a lack of love for paramiko lately -- I don't want to get into any of that, but if you do want to get away from paramiko, you can use the system, ssh2, or asyncssh transport plugins in scrapli!
* You, like me, don't really love ncclient, but want to NETCONF all the things. I personally find ncclient a bit obtuse, there is a fair bit of ""magic"" going on with dynamic attributes (getattr for vendor methods and things like that) and such that make it (at least for me) not super intutive. While scrapli\_netconf is the latest addition to the scrapli family and does not have 100% feature parity with ncclient, it covers all the basics, and I am happy to add features if folks need them (and will over time anyway I'm sure!)

&#x200B;

Why you may not want to use scrapli:

* You are not working with one of the ""core"" platforms (IOSXE, IOSXR, Junos, NXOS, EOS) and aren't ready/interested to jump into a little bit of DIY (I promise its not hard!) to get your platform working (but you can still try out the GenericDriver which may be enough for whatever you've got going on!).
* You are already doing all the things with RESTCONF or some other HTTP based thing -- yep, no need for scrapli then!
* You are using Ansible/Salt/something else and don't really need/want to do low-level stuff like this because there are modules for that already.
* ???

&#x200B;

I may as well bring up the big question since I'm sure it will get asked: why not use netmiko? If netmiko is working for you then by all means keep on keepin' on! Kirk and I are friends and if it weren't for netmiko and all the amazing work Kirk has done for the community I wouldn't ever have built any of this anyway! To address the question though; asyncio is the most obvious differentiator. 100% of OpenSSH config support could be another big selling point to make a move to trying out scrapli (would mean using system transport). Not wanting to use paramiko (for whatever reasons), and lastly speed speed speed!

You probably would prefer to stick to using netmiko if you are a windows user (scrapli with ssh2/paramiko/telnet transports should work on windows but I don't windows so not sure whats up there), or you have non-core platforms and don't want to do a bit of DIY to make it work in scrapli (see above).

&#x200B;

And now for a quick intro/example to scrapli!

    from scrapli.driver.core import IOSXEDriver
    
    my_device = {
        ""host"": ""172.31.254.1"",
        ""ssh_config_file"": True,
        ""auth_strict_key"": False
    }
    with IOSXEDriver(**my_device) as conn:
    	print(""Gathering 'show run'!"")
    	show_run_response = conn.send_command(command=""show run"")
    	print(f""Show run complete in {show_run_response.elapsed_time} seconds, successful: {not show_run_response.failed}"")
    
    	print(""Gathering 'show tech'!"")
    	show_tech_response = conn.send_command(command=""show tech"")
    	print(f""Show run complete in {show_tech_response.elapsed_time} seconds, successful: {not show_tech_response.failed}"")
    	print(f""Show tech was {len(show_tech_response.result.splitlines())} lines long!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!"")

I've been scripting and automating tasks using Python for a few years now, and I'd really like to share some of them in their entirety with the rest of the world, as well as receive feedback on improvement.  However I'm not quite sure the best way to do so.

My scripts all reference roughly 4 or 5 library files, or python files in a subdirectory that house common functions I reuse throughout most of my scripts.  I have some of my code on GitHub, however it's not the easiest avenue to discuss the code.

I recently (as in, 2 days ago) decided to finally start a blog I've always wanted to create, however I'm trying to figure out the best way to share a full script in there.  I can't easily copy/paste the code into a new blog post, as some of them are just too big.  The other issue is having the library files I mentioned earlier as a dependency on each script.

I've considered putting all relevant directories and files in a .zip file and just providing that as the script itself.  Does anyone have any ideas on this, or seen it done on another blog/method in a really good way?


For reference, here's some of the scripts I'm looking to share that I've written over the years, big and small:

* Send an identical email to a list of Office 365 recipients
* Log into a list of IP addresses and execute a set of commands, then log output
 * These can be a static set of commands, or provided by the user at runtime 
* Log into a list of switches and check for any ports in a STP blocked state, then display the results
* DNS lookups on a list of IP's
* Log into a list of remote sites or stores (I work in retail), and reboot/configure only the ports with phones, AP's, and/or other CDP enabled devices on them
* On the F5, create/delete a VIP/Pool
* Convert a provided MAC address in any format (decimal, colon, or no delimiter) into whichever format my script needs
 * 12:34:56:78:90:ab
 * 1234.5678.90ab
 * 1234567890ab
* Configure a provided interface with a specified vlan, default settings (for our environment), wipe the interface, bounce it, etc

A couple that I'm most proud of (so far):

* Firewall ACL script - Requires a few inputs at runtime: one or more source IP addresses and subnet masks, one or more dest. IP addresses and masks, and one or more ports and its protocol.  Then the script logs into the specified firewall, determines the source interface to use, and determines one at a time if each requested source/dest/port combo is already allowed.  The ones that are already allowed, it notifies the user.  The ones that aren't, it will generate an ACL with Object-Groups, display them to the user for confirmation, then configure them on the ASA.
* Device lookup - I can input an IP address or MAC address (in any format), and it will search through my entire network to locate where the device is currently plugged in.  Then it will output the following:
 * Device IP address
 * Device MAC address
 * Device DNS name (if any)
 * Switch name (it's plugged into)
 * Switch IP address
 * Path to client through network
 * Any NAC or 802.1x relevant information, if any
 * The active config for that interface

 -It then prompts the user for a list of options to perform, such as change the vlan, bounce the port, wipe it, etc
* Standardize remote router config - For any of our remote sites that are based off a template, sometimes they aren't identical to the newest template config version.  This will log into a remote site, make a backup of the existing config, extract certain site-specific information from the config, run the newest template (another Python script) with this info, then upload the newly generated config as the startup config and schedule a reload at a specified time.  It then logs all results to a CSV file, along with any errors that occurred and at which step of the process.

I have some more, but this is a pretty good summary of what I've done somewhat.

balepj,networking,1554672756.0,"About 4 or 5 months ago I started working for a new company, and I've never really seen an environment where the network team is so ostracized from the rest of the IT department.  

A little background.  It's a mid-sized company of about 3k employees in 5 different states (about 300 remote sites, 2 data centers, and 5 floors in a high rise building in a downtown metro.)

Every group in our IT department has multiple team members that have been with the company for years (usually 10+ years) except for our team.  The network team here has had a high rate of turnover and supposedly is constantly rebuilt ""from scratch"" every 2-3 years.  Right now my direct supervisor who has been with the company about 7-8 months has the highest tenure on the Network Team.  There are three other coworkers all of whom were hired after I was.

Anyway, almost off the bat from day one, I have discovered our team is pretty much the dumping ground for all the other teams.  Every little problem here is shoved in our basket and the network is blamed for EVERYTHING.  Pretty much a living stereotype.  An application crashed on a user?  Sent to Networking.  Computer blue screened?  Sent to Networking.  Website is returning a 403 Forbidden?  Sent to networking.  We usually have to fight tooth and nail to get said tickets out of our basket, where a juvenile game of back and forth proceeds with the ticket coming back to us 2-3 times and usually nasty emails circulate about us to management.  (We're not team players.  We're not interested in helping.  We can't figure anything out.)

The security team is the worst offender.  They will make undocumented changes in the firewall, ""experimenting"", block something important, and then forward any tickets directly to our team.  They will not share any kind of management or visibility over the firewall's logs, so we have no way of knowing their stuff is blocking it, other than doing a pcap on a client machine and determining we're not completing a three way handshake.

Sometimes when we've pushed back and proved it wasn't the network, it led to C-Levels getting included on e-mails they really have no reason to be included on.

The worst part is a brick wall of resistance against doing any kind of changes.  When I first got here I mapped out the network and identified all kinds of things that needed to be swapped out or improved, including single points of failure for critical infrastructure elements.  Any attempt to get any of it done though, is met with outright resistance (""Why do you have to do this?  It's been working fine for the last 20 years!"") and almost no change window will get approved, not even on the weekend at 2:00am or whatever. They just won't let us do anything.

When anything does get approved, the other teams will utterly stonewall us, refusing to provide any information about their end of things that would help the upgrade succeed, to the point where we pretty much have had to realize ""this isn't going to work"" and cancel the change.

I've gone to management explaining my concerns and telling them if they want to do things differently and want things to work better around here, the culture has to change.. basically something has to give.  I've been told to watch my step and not rock the boat, and that ""at the end of the day we are here to keep this place online so we can make money.  You want to take stuff OFFline.  That's not how we work here.""

The teams also go and do team building stuff like mini golfing or go karting etc, once a month, and we're not invited.  We're the only ones who aren't invited and the stated reason is that we have to be available at all times in case anything stops working.

3. When meeting with local city council/legislators, what can we expect in terms of red tape/road blocks (if any)?
4. Cost of overhead thereafter?
5. How long would a project like this take depending on its size? 
6. What else should we know before going into this?

The idea is to run fiber directly to the home. 

And for the super rural areas, the plan is to implement a WISP network to cut down on fiber costs.

It made me think.  We're moving ""forward"" by going to *NIX OS'es which are all quite old and literally from the very earliest stages of computing.  Now granted, I know that Linux is still heavily used because it's just better than Windows at certain things... but one has to think:  if everything is going to Linux Shells and the like, and there's this push to stop managing our devices through individual CLI prompts... aren't we just gonna turn into Systems Admins?

To me a job posting that says ""must be able to administrate a linux system, must be able to write python and bash scripts, must know tcp/ip and associate protocols"" that sounds like a Systems Administrator job, not a Network Admin/Network Engineer.

Also with Dell and other vendors coming out with new blades where it's a high powered Data Center Switch + Server in one, at what point are we all just systems guys?

78pdxd,networking,1508953782.0,"Hi guys, appreciate any help here. I work for a software company and we are building an iPad app for a large fundraising event that will facilitate a live auction. So as the auction progresses 300 users' iPads will simultaneously update with the latest price, bid, etc.

We have done smaller events before and the WiFi at the various venues is always a shit-show, even with like 30 devices. Although we are only responsible for building the software, if the WiFi goes to hell and the app doesn't work, of course we get blamed.

This time with the sheer number of devices and importance of money being passed around, we are going to demand certain specs from the tech people to make sure they can handle it. Not to try to tell the network techs how to do their jobs, but moreso to have a record that we asked for a certain level of spec that we are confident will work. **I am not personally setting up this network.** But if things go to shit and we can prove they didn't provide what we asked, blame won't fall on us. 

So that's where I need help. I have some experience with small office and home networking, but nothing at this scale. Here are some more details and my initial thoughts, any advice would be amazing.

- The venue will be 1 giant room. We do not have details on the dimensions yet, but obviously it's pretty huge to accommodate over 300 people.
- Our app doesn't do anything heavy on data. So the emphasis is on connectivity over bandwidth/speed.
- To reiterate - all 300 iPads will be refreshing simultaneously when the auction item/price/bid updates. So it will be short periods of no load, followed by huge spikes.
- The 300 iPads do not need to talk to each other on LAN, they just need to hit the internet. So this opens up the possibility for different networks if that makes things easier.
- We use Ubiquiti UniFi AP Pros at the office which work quite well. Assuming the venue uses similar quality access points, how many should they use to cover 300 iPads? 10 spread all around the room?
- I have read that iOS devices are stupid at roaming between APs. How can we remedy this?
- I know our office router DHCP server can only hand out 254 IP addresses. What's the correct terminology for setting up multiple ""ranges"" so there can be more?

What else am I forgetting??

The issue was reported to the Voice Network Operations Center (NOC) for investigation. Tier III Support was engaged for assistance isolating the root cause. It was determined that calls were not completing due to a configuration limiting call flows across multiple Level 3 voice switches. At 15:31 GMT, a configuration adjustment was made to correct the issue, and Inbound and outbound call flows immediately restored for all customers. Investigations revealed that an improper entry was made to a call routing table during provisioning work being performed on the Level 3 network. This was the configuration change that led to the outage. The entry did not specify a telephone number to limit the configuration change to, resulting in non-subscriber country code '1' calls to be released while the entry remained present. The configuration adjustments deleted this entry to resolve the outage.

4naezf,networking,1465472589.0,"Ah the trials and tribulations of providing a free wifi signal.  I run a hospital system network.  We provide free guest wifi at every facility.  We have one facility in a rural/low income area.  Late at night, our free wifi attracts shady people like moth to the flame.  Our facility crew wants us to deny access to these people.  ***This is a 24 hour facility*** and the guest wireless is for patients/families.  Our production wireless is an entirely different animal which has 802.1x and all that jazz. 

This creates quite a conundrum- what's the best way to deny the public access to public wifi.  My initial thought was to simply schedule the APs closest to the area they congregate in to turn down at night.  I've told my mgmt that this is a physical security issue, not a network one.  

Anyone here had to deal with similar?  This is more of a policy issue than a technical one.  

edit: some scenarios I've mulled over-

1) RF Scheduling -best bet imo

2) Password their guest -how do you give out password so that it stays within the facility?  Loose lips would sink this ship rather quickly.  This is a small community and people talk, I have a feeling the password would get out within a week and we'd have to change it weekly to keep up.

3) Engage Security Team and have them monitor and restrict physical access to areas at night that are serving wifi (parking lot).  I like this one because it makes people do their jobs and it attacks the root of the problem- the crew doesn't like shady people hanging around the facility common areas.

***4) Wifi banana***:  /u/HoorayInternetDrama reminded me that there is a relatively new solution on the market.  I'll make sure to suggest it to mgmt.

I find myself baffled by this. I've been a support engineer for going on 6 years and a sysadmin before that. Admittedly, as a sysadmin, my packet analysis skills were next to nil. Maybe I could find a rogue DHCP server. But in this job where I have to troubleshoot our networking product that touches every layer of the stack, I've learned a great deal in quickly analyzing problems with packet analysis (Wireshark, basically); where to point the finger and what the likely culprits are. I don't have to spin my wheels wondering ""is it this? could it be that?"" I know packet analysis doesn't always solve the issue, but you can know better where to dig in and definitively be able to say ""IT'S NOT THE NETWORK, YOU JERKS. IT'S ALMOST NEVER THE NETWORK AND HERE'S THE PROOF. IT'S YOUR TERRIBLY TERRIBLY WRITTEN APP, YOU GIT""

ahem

I don't usually say those things to customers.

I run into smart people who are solid troubleshooters but when they feel like a packet capture is the next logical step (usually the last one for them), they will open Wireshark, scroll, scroll, scroll, shrug, and close Wireshark.

I understand that someone can be knowledgable about networking and troubleshooting in terms of products or vendors, but I've interviewed CCIEs that can't tell me when/if an IP address or MAC address changes when traveling from point A to point B. I know I can take the knowledge and skills I've learned by staring at pcaps for hours and hours over the last several years to any other job (except maaaaybe barista), but there aren't any letters after my name.

So. Why don't more people do this? Is it intimidating? Overwhelming? Don't know the protocols well enough? I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but can I get a witness?

**Edit:**

Looooving the comments. So good. It may seem like a have a boner for packet analysis, and, well, I kinda do. But. BUT. It's kinda like when you first start learning Linux. Every time you have to dig in and fix something you get a lil thrill. You actually kinda love it when stuff doesn't work right because it gives you a chance to get your hands dirty. But then after a while and you've picked up some solid skills? You kinda just want that shit to work. I mean, you can go digging if you have to, but ugh. Once you start picking up packet skills, every network problem looks like a nail to your new hammer. Break out Wireshark! That's cool, it's fun, it's part of the process. Later, that hammer only comes out when it needs to. The thing I'm commenting on is that for a lot of networking pros I run into, their hammer looks like: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/RTnOvp6.jpg)

[Awful boot](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/7RkAAOSw91Ng7U9S/s-l1600.jpg)

And it was a somewhat frustrating experience. Not TOO bad, but I must say that is the dumbest connector boot design ever, and it's really popular for some reason.

Here's why it's terrible. The flaps on the sides. I understand they are there to prevent the tab getting snagged on something. But they're not actually guaranteed to work for that because something can still technically get in between them and snag the tab.

But by far the worst thing about them is that you cannot easily press the tab and release the connector. It's actually quite annoying, even when you figure out the best way to do it, you still can't quite get a good push on the tab and it often feels like you're scraping the connector as you're pulling the cable out.

Every other design has realized this, so they have the anti-snag thing go over the tab so you can press on it directly and release the cable, also guaranteeing the tab will never get snagged. Easy, sensible, works. But whoever designed this boot was too stupid to realize this, did they even test their creation once? And then for some reason it caught on and is now quite a popular design.

Am I missing something? It's terrible, right? I know I'm overreacting, but what are you gonna do... first world problems.

Edit: Reading the comments, I guess I this is actually one of the nicer designs when you consider how god awful some of the other ones are, ending up under the tab or hardening over time...

Thrangrycat allows an attacker to make persistent modification to the Trust Anchor module via FPGA bitstream modification, thereby defeating the secure boot process and invalidating Cisco’s chain of trust at its root.* **While the flaws are based in hardware, Thrangrycat can be exploited remotely without any need for physical access.** *Since the flaws reside within the hardware design, it is unlikely that any software security patch will fully resolve the fundamental security vulnerability.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/bs9y83/thrangrycat_ciscos_latest_vulnerability/,"""Thrangrycat"" - Cisco's latest vulnerability",,124,71,0.95
akf9yu,networking,1548619113.0,"My older brother was a senior network architect at a subsidiary of a Fortune 500 company before getting laid off some 2 1/2 years ago. He felt pretty burned, so he decided to take some 6 months off, but soon began interviewing again. He was making $125k in his previous position and foolishly (it seems to me, but he would also admit now) turned down some positions with comparable salary in the later months during his interviews, looking for a role that promised more interesting work (in roughly the same field— network architecture). 

Through a series of extremely unfortunate events, he is now nearly homeless (~2 years and all of his savings later). He now relies heavily on his family and friend community to help pay for air b&b hostels while he hustles to make some money recharging electric scooters (lime, etc) just to afford some food. He has told his friends and family community that he is distributing his resume regularly and it seems like he has a few phone interviews every so often, but I’m wondering what the job landscape is like for someone with his expertise (15 years as a network engineer at various companies).
Is an employment gap of 2-3 years fatal to one’s career?

Should he, if he hasn’t already, set his sights on a position with much lower pay ($60k..?) in order to at least get back on his feet?

Assuming he isn’t somehow self-sabotaging himself in the interviewing process, is it likely that word is getting around amongst the recruiters/interviewers that he was laid off from his last position and that it is hindering him moving forward in the interview process? I don’t know exactly why he was laid off, but he has intimated that it was largely due to his failure to be amicable during really stressful periods at the company (some insubordinate behavior..?). 

Does he need to try to enter a new geographical market?

Is over-qualification a reason to turn someone down for a junior network architect position?

I want the best for my brother, but my lack of knowledge about the field of his expertise makes it difficult for me suggest, with any clout, a change in his current efforts. I’m wondering if his expectations should adjusted if he hopes to get a salaried position in the field again.

cta1j8,networking,1566352423.0,"I was tasked with implementing DNA Center into our infrastructure, from the ground up. Let's embark on this journey and see how it plays out. 

Completed thus far:

1. discovery phase
2. hardware/licensing ordered (in hand)
3. UCS (3 Servers, 6 Host)
4. CIMC Installed
5. DNA Center installed on UCS
6. Fully built lab that replicates our prod environment
7. Templates built for various switches
8. golden images loaded based on switch model
9. Global hierarchy built out (partially, more on that later)
10. Provisioned a switch remotely, locally, and in the lab)

Before I get into my experience with DNA-C Appliance, I want to pre-warn ANYONE that is looking into rolling this out.

1. Do **NOT** under any circumstance, forget:
   1. CIMC Password
   2. Maglev Password
   3. DNA-C Admin Password

Standing DNA up has been frustrating to say the least. I had to build routes from the core to the pizza box. I had to build routes to the lab that only traversed the internet VLAN and nothing else (because of how or environment is set up, if I staged a live switch, it would break one of our sites due to IP conflicts). 

Frustration 1:

**RADIUS**

If you plan on implementing RADIUS to access DNA-C so you do not have to create/use local accounts -think again. This is not possible without ISE (very clever Cisco). I spent countless hours troubleshooting why RADIUS wouldn't work. I followed their documentation to a T (funny, they have documentation for something that doesn't work). I spent hours on the phone, Webex, and email with TAC -to no resolve. 

I created a new friendly name on the RADIUS server, used the existing Cisco shared secret that we use with other Cisco gear. I tried creating it from the ground up (to ensure there wasn't a key mismatch)

TAC Resolution (from the guy that created the documentation for RADIUS/DNA) ""Implement ISE, RADIUS to the DNAC simply doesn't work"" -fantastic!!

Advice: ***Implement ISE alongside DNA or be prepared to make user accounts and privileges (your own little AD)***

&#x200B;

Frustration 2:

**Templates**

Get ready to configure the hell out of some switches. I know with automation comes a lot of manual behind the scenes shit to get it up and running, but my word. Cisco, no baseline templates? You have to build from scratch. Beings we are in the middle of a network refresh, the sentiment of having to configure a switch once (template building), granted the config is correct (DNA yells a lot), I guess it's ok. Once you iron the kinks out and the template is bullet proof, you can go ahead and lock in your Day0 template. After your Day0 is tried and tested, its time to build your DayN template (this is where you will adopt and claim a switch into a site within DNAC), pretty much prod ready.

Templates ARE fickle. The way DNA interprets them is a mystery. I have taken a switch config from one that I was replacing, threw its config into a DNA template, and it error'ed out every single time. 

Advice: ***use variables properly. I found strings worked better on L2 switches (for mgmt interfaces) and integers worked better on L3 switches (for mgmt interfaces and plan interfaces).*** 

&#x200B;

Frustration 3:

**Global Settings**

The hierarchy is downright despicable. It is a mess to say the least. Clunky and certainly not intuitive. The interface was not planned out well, I am not sure what design language they were going for, but I am not a fan. For instance ""Provision"" contextual menu at the top, houses sub-options, that you wouldn't know, because its not clear. This so happens to be where DNA's bread and butter live ""Plug and Play"" or ""UPnP"" to kick of provisioning. 

Menu Navigation goes something like this:

* Design
   * Network Hierarchy 
   * Network Settings
      * Network
      * Device Credentials
      * IP Address Pools
      * SP Profiles --> QoS
      * Wireless
   * Image Repository
   * Network Profiles
   * Authentication Template
* Policy
   * Dashboard
   * Group-Based Access Control
      * Group-Based Access Control Policies
      * Scalable Groups
      * Access Contract
   * IP Based Access Control
      * IP Based Access Control Policies
      * IP Network Groups
      * Access Contract
   * Application
      * Application Policies
      * Applications
      * Application Sets
      * Queuing Profiles 
   * Traffic Copy
      * Traffic Copy Policies
      * Traffic Copy Destination
      * Traffic Copy Contract
   * Virtual Network
* Provision
   * Devices
      * Inventory
      * Plug and Play
   * Fabric
   * Services
* Assurance
   * Health
      * Overall
      * Network
      * Client
      * Application
   * Dashboards
      * Sensor
      * Dashboard Library
   * Issues
      * Global Issues
      * All Issues
   * Manage
      * Sensor-Driven Tests
      * Client Intelligent Capture
      * AP Intelligent Capture
      * Issue Settings
   * Platform
      * Overview
      * Manage --> Bundles --> Configurations
      * Developer Toolkit --> APIs --> Integrations Flows --> Data and Reports --> Multivendor Support
   * Runtime Dashboard

As you can see, this is very convoluted. I am used to it now, but you can see why it can be unwelcoming when just beginning. 

&#x200B;

Frustration 4:

**Provisioning**

This is what DNA was built for, automating switch configurations by the way of templates. Well, I can tell you, when it works, its amazing -WHEN IT WORKS.

I have had more error then provisioned messages. You claim the switch, select the iOS image you want (upgrade to golden image if you so choose), set the parameters you defined in the templates, set and claim the device to the site in which this will be deployed. Sit back, cross your fingers, and prepare to be pissed. 

There is a bug with chrome, while filling out your parameters, you can not scroll down far enough to see ""DHCP or default gateway properties"". 

* Temp work arounds: F11 (sometimes works). Enter the value in notepad, copy it, go to the line above, click then tab and paste. Janky, but works. 

Advice: ***do not interrupt DNA when it is provisioning. you will end up with a blank switch (no image) in ROMMON. If you find yourself in this predicament, console into the switch ""wr erase"" ""wr mem"" ""sh boot"" make sure it is NOT the .bin file, make sure this is pointed to ""BOOT variable = flash:packages.conf"" if you don't, you will disable UPnP and DNA will not be able to do its job.***

I understand that every network is different. Every template will vary. Every use case will vary. This is just MY experience thus far. I do NOT hate DNA (contrary to what I have written). It is a newer product with a lot of bugs. It has a great use case and demographic. I am just giving you my POV (the engineer in the trenches). Others that use DNA, once it is already set up, will think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread -I will probably join them in that consensus. For now, while standing it up, I still think it needs work. 

&#x200B;

Right now I am fighting a 9200 L2. Let me know if you want to hear about the fun I am having with this.... 

&#x200B;

I hope this didn't deter anyone. I just needed to rant more then anything, and maybe I will run across someone that can give me pointers and help my deployment go a lot smoother then it has been. If you made it this far -CONGRATS!

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Cisco DNA is great when it works. It still has a lot of shortcomings and obstacles to overcome. Be prepared to exert a lot of time and energy implementing this into your environments.

I love it when an internal IT user, such as a database admin or application admin, walks up to me or my team and says, ""I did a traceroute to [this] and my latency on two of the hops is way too high. You need to fix it"". 


This is especially fun when the end-to-end for the app at layer 3 is <5ms w/no packet loss, and the ""hops"" are ~25ms w/~2% loss. Yeah...we'll get right on that, Mr. App Admin.  While we're at it, we'll be sure to tell the router's control-plane that the 3 or more ICMP Unreachable responses to your ICMP Echo request are more important than whatever else the router might be doing is...


Granted, sometimes there are issues along the path (*i.e. async routing issues, slow-path convergence via fail-over link, etc*), but most of us know (or should know) the latency output is generally not reflective of the application's actual performance over the network. 


**RAS (Richard Steenbergen)** explains pretty well via presentation why traceroute is not what most people think it is, and why they are likely misappropriating it's use, or at the very least, not leveraging it as effectively as they could: [RAS' TraceRoute Presentation at NANOG](https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf)

I'm ""the IT guy"", not a networking specialist, but hopefully someone has been in this situation.

Our branch offices send their voice traffic to a telco-owned Cisco 1900 with a CSU/DSU add-in card. As I understand, this goes to a sort of managed VPN service which allows it to communicate with the main phone system in another office. This link went dead around midday Saturday, coincident with some inclement weather. The only diagnostic information I know of comes from the automated ticket log:

    TRANSPORT DIAGNOSE: THE TRANSPORT FACILITY IS CURRENTLY IN FAILED STATE.

And then the ticket got assigned to somebody else:

    An Access supplier problem was detected. This ticket has been referred to the Access Supplier for repair.

A phrase which doesn't exist in Google, but I presume refers to the contracted manager or owner of the circuit. There are no updates since.

Hours of phone calls to AT&T have bounced between many people in two repair departments, the consensus of which is that ""it's not our ticket/circuit"" and ""the last update was that the ticket was assigned for dispatch"". No further information is provided, save for one person who was able to tell me there was an alarm condition and it was a central office issue.

Having no management access to the Cisco myself, all I can verify on my end is that:

- I have no CSU/DSU link status lights

- I have a yellow alarm status light

- The link lights turn green when I connect a loopback cable, suggesting the premises equipment works.

I have gained no more information about what the problem is, but have learned that our one issue is referred to by three different ticket numbers amongst AT&T's different support facilities, each of which is equally lacking in updates.

I am browsing this subreddit almost daily and I would like to suggest a new type of post. This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.

An example of a valid post will be:

\- We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to ""keep x amount of backups"" or ""keep the last X backups"".  Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups.

* Both power supplies show output fail, POE goes down
* Boss man calls me, asks to SSH into device
* Show power shows inline status bad/off
* Boss man hits *off* switch on power supply i hear a **BOOM** on the phone
* ask Boss if he is OK
* I went and got spare power supplies. Go to turn off input to other power supply **BOOM**

So any ideas of what happened? Bad cable run? or something else?

**Edit:** switch was installed in 2013 only new variable was the addition of access points this was not the first access point connected


We actually connected a laptop to the switchport that the access point was connected to. Port came up and laptop got a dhcp lease

**Edit 2:** power infrastructure was professionally installed and inspected, located in California.


power supplies were making arcing sounds every couple of seconds before the were powered off.

When I pushed the power off switch the blow back was enough to give me a small shock I had some slight tingling in my arm most of the day and now the joints in my wrist are sore.

In hindsight I should not have touched the thing to begin with, but it never crossed my mind that both power supplies would blow that way.

* pull out the blade and boot, POST is successful on power supplies blades are powered up and connectivity and POE is working.

Having some dev skill is nice and you could certainly DIY when it comes to network automation, but there are full time developers that in my opinion, are better equipped to take on the automation challenges that are facing networks today. 


This is akin to some guy who can fix the occasional leaky faucet or replace a fixture. Maybe some guys are more handy than others and can lay their own foundation, put up their on dry wall and insulation, but for those of us who don't have those skills, we hire professionals/specialists with the right skill to solve the challenges at hand. We don't say, 'I'm gonna learn how to fix the myself'. It's just not worth the time versus what you'd have to pay for a professional who could do the job better than you.  Why is it different with networking when it comes to programming?


Maybe these devs don't understand networks,  but that's where network engineers come in and fill in the gaps.  Developers write code, build distributed systems and tooling all day. Maybe you can do it too,  but can the average network engineer really do it better than someone who writes code for their day job? 


The other thing I wanted to point out is there are way more developers than network engineers. What automation challenges are facing today's network and why aren't developers flocking to solve these issues?

Thanks for your help on my last post:

I found a way of getting this done that works for us and i thought i'd post here in case anyone else wants to know.

What i ended up doing was setting up Converged access on our ct5760 Wireless controller and 3650 switches, what this means is the switches act as a secondary controller (mobility agent), intercepting the capwap tunnels and put the traffic straight on to the wire instead of the tunnel going all the way back to the core (you could also use flex-connect if you have a unified controller, not sure about other vendors sorry). Now that i had the traffic switching locally for the buildings i applied an ACL on the trunk blocking udp 5353 and anything to 224.0.0.251 (edit: and ""ff02::fb"" for ipv6) (in both directions for ipv4 and ipv6).

This cut down mdns traffic immensely and the Apple TVs seem to be more responsive, not kicking off/refusing to connect.

I also wanted to re-advertise the mDNS across all wlans at the local switch. I used the built in cisco mDNS gateway to do this. It performs a lot better when it only has 10-20 Apple TVs to work with lol. Just make sure you block mdns on the trunk before setting this up, the 3650's can't handle that much mdns traffic i've found.

I will add that converged access without cisco prime means that any configuration changes done need to be replicated to all Mobility agents manually which is a pain.

The last time I made BGP changes with them it was a simple trouble ticket, but now they have this fancy Configuration Change dialog where you can select exactly what you want.  This blows away everyone else's processes.

If you've spent any time trying to make BGP changes with any carriers, I'm sure you've encountered the ring around the rosie:

Call tech support.  Tells you to talk to account manager.  Call account manager.  Tells you to open a ticket.

Or my favorite, I wanted to add an IPv4 network to our BGP filter on a circuit with Some Other Carrier.  After 19 days of just trying to them to do anything, they told me it was scheduled for 29 days later.  This is a direct quote from a project manager:
>Our SLA on these type of orders is 30 days however many happen sooner, that is why I had reached out to see if our time frame would be an issue.
>We are working on it and it is now in the Circuit Design stage, I will continue monitoring it and provide you with updates. 

They need a project manager and a circuit design stage to make a simple BGP change.  All told it took them 48 days.  In that same round of changes I made Century Link completed theirs in about 40 minutes a piece.

>Learn how the protocols really work, from theory to implementation, rather than how to configure them. Learn how devices switch packets, and why they work this way, rather than the available bandwidth on the latest gear. Learn how to design a network, rather than how to deploy vendor gear.

>It’s time we stopped spreading the “if you just learn to code, you’ll be in demand in five years” hype. If you have network engineering skills, then learning to code is a good thing.

Where before I would have scheduled one site per night I'll now be able to schedule all remaining sites in one night and just watch them work.  Moving forward this allows me to be more consistent and timely with upgrading.

Future improvments will have a web interface from which you can schedule uploads/upgrades and view the current status of jobs, but that's once I get a better understanding of Flask and can figure out non-blocking asynchronous celery sticks, or something. At this time they're simple Python scripts that run in Docker containers, one for uploads and one for the upgrade process alone. A simple shell script allows me to run the containers with a single simple command and some parameters (pair hostname+version). In this case I just scheduled a cron job to run each job.

Of course my upload container is separated from the upgrade and intended to be run ahead of time. The upload script does a lot of hoopla but ultimately just uploads via SCP.  The upgrade process takes the following steps:

* Send a message to Teams telling me the process is starting
* Verify the appropriate file exists on both ASAs for the desired software platform to upgrade to
* Set boot variables
* Reload the standby
* Wait for it to come up to Standby Ready status
* Failover
* Reload the new standby
* Wait for it to come up
* Fail back over (if the 'primary' is the current standby, otherwise stay where it is)
* Double check the current running software version on both boxes is the new one
* Enable the ASA REST API module
* Configure the ASA REST API module
* Update NetBox so the pair is documented as having been upgraded
* Finally, send me a Teams message of completion.

My try/excepts ensure if there's any issues I get a failure Teams message instead of the completion one, and as a last resort my containers all have the hostname appended to their name so I can review the logs if something goes horribly, horribly wrong.  Here's my logging snippet.

I'm in the early stages of planning a FTTH ISP in a small city in Central Europe.

I was quoted $82 USD per meter (without tax) to lay fiber from their nearest POP, which comes out to be around $750k USD after taxes for about 8km.

There's only one major Tier 2 provider in my country, so the only other option would be to organize all the trenching, permits, etc, myself and bring the fiber to them, but that adds an enormous amount of overhead to a, currently, 2-person company.

I'm curious if this figure seems typical in the industry. I was expecting the price to be about half this, especially in Central Europe. I should add that 95% of the route between the POP and the suggested drop points is one public highway road, which I would assume simplifies this process a bit.

ku7ee5,networking,1610252984.0,"I jumped right into a network admin position out of college in 2018. It was a blessing to land the position to be honest because I had zero experience whatsoever except for networking classes.

The pay is very nice and the benefits are too. It is a smaller enterprise company with a nice culture. The management is lenient on a lot of things, and they embrace new technology. I've made some nice friends and learned exponentially more than when I was in school taking network-focused classes.

Since I've been there, they funded all of my certifications entirely and gave me time to study on the clock. The downside is that I'm now hitting a plateau, and there isn't an open position higher up and won't be for another couple years they say, even though my boss has told me that he sees me as a future engineer based on my learning ability. My skills have sharpened immensely but I fear I will lose them if I'm not challenged to keep them sharp. I've been told that I have guaranteed job security with my current performance at the company and that covid stuff is nothing for me worry about with job cuts being popular nowadays.

Network admin'ing for an enterprise company is fun at first, but being a tier 3 ticket guy with not many cool projects on the side gets monotonous sometimes.. especially when there are engineers getting all of the cool new projects that I feel I could outperform.

Now after a small amount of job hunting and interviewing, I have been offered a Network Engineer job with a consulting company. This company works with bigger companies to help evolve their networks and troubleshoot any weird issues during a certain period of time after the evolution. I would be assigned one company at a time as a project, and move on to another once the project is finished. The position is also remote, so I wouldn't be bound to any location.

I'm facing a dilemma because, on one side, my heart is telling me that I'll be throwing away a secure, good paying job with decent co-workers. On the other hand, this is an opportunity to grow and learn. With the covid nonsense, job security is a huge deal I feel. But I'm also single (by that I mean that I have a lovely girlfriend, but we are not married yet), young and super motivated and want to take advantage of that while I can. The pay at this new position would be basically be a lateral step.

My question(s) to you guys:

Which position have you generally preferred as a networker? Admin or Engineer?

Is this too big of a risk to take given current world events? I know smooth seas never made a skilled sailor, but I've thought about this from many angles and am trying very hard to make a diligent decision.

The owners gave me free reign to design the entire IT infrastructure for the new building. I researched everything exhaustively, designed the server room, bought all the equipment, picked out the subcontractors, everything. It's been fun for a geek like me.

But I've never messed with a network as complex as this one will be, and as a jack-of-all trades IT guy, networking is not my strongest area. Nevertheless I did my best and made up a [network diagram of my plan](https://content.spiceworksstatic.com/service.community/p/post_images/0000374905/5d97c6f8/attached_image/455_Network_Diagram_%281%29.png).

I then crowdsourced it to the Spiceworks community asking for advice/critiques. In the past they've been a good resource for me, and indeed this time I got what appeared to be really good advice from networking experts. They critiqued my initial plans and convinced me that I was ""**over-VLANing**"". After many revisions they helped me evolve my network plans to [this](https://content.spiceworksstatic.com/service.community/p/post_images/0000375209/5d9ca443/attached_image/455_Network_Diagram.png). From 7 VLANs to 4.

But the introduction of an L3 switch for inter-VLAN routing and changing the gateway to something other than the firewall were both fairly intimidating to me, so I hired a consultant to review my plans and assist with implementation if the need arose. He took one look at my plans and basically said ""Wow.....ok..... that's not how I would do it but I'll implement it however you want."" With a very *""Your funeral.""* tone.

So I ask him how he would do it, and **he tells me IP phones, management interfaces, printers, basically everything should get it's own VLAN.**

\*sigh\*

So I hire a DIFFERENT consultant, from a different company, hoping he will either agree with the last guy, or agree with the Spiceworks community. Neither. **He recommends a flat network with no VLANs** for a company our size (about 40 office employees and a dozen remote).

To date all major vendors now have their kit in a virtual form, you can spin up a virtual SRX, Cisco etc in a matter of minutes.  Throw in some automation into the mix and voila you've just setup a basic network in under an hour.  So this got us talking how vendors could use virtual labs to actually test our skills, pretty much the same way as CCIE lab exam but at NA/NP level.  I know there are simulations in some exams, but you're limited to the capabilities of the simulator. 


To me it makes much more sense, you'd need to do some serious studying to know how to setup BGP, OSPF etc memorising answers won't really work in this sort of situation. 


From my experience in a previous role, I know McAfee's professional services certification follow a similar approach.

How do you guys describe your role as a network engineer to non-technical folks?

We were asked to describe our roles, and I said ""IT"" work. Without missing a beat, the exec took out his phone, immediately handed it to me, and asked me to tshoot why it was so slow.

I half-jokingly said that they'll need a ticket before I can do any type of work and expanded that I will be leading the team on the transition, design, and implementation of new acquisition networks, implementing security policies, and datacenter/cloud work.

Keep in mind, this tenant is completely separate from our organization so we are not required to provide and network services.

Upon their initial move-in, they asked if they'd be able to hop onto our network for internet access and we explained to them that our network/equipment is off-limits. We did allow them to use the 2nd-floor portion of the patch panel so that they could install their own equipment and be able to patch accordingly. They agreed to this and that was the end of that.

Over the weekend, our switch at this site dropped. Went in this morning and found that they had unplugged about 15 of our cables directly from our switch (not from the patch panel) and also must've unplugged our fiber uplink and then failed to reseat the SFP because the site was offline the entire weekend. This put a very bad taste in our mouths.

mm1yvw,networking,1617801794.0,"I am working on a project that requires me to spin up a virtual lab, simulating the live environment, test changes there and then, once the changes are verified in lab - apply them to the live environment. 

One of the big hurdles I ran into - virtual labs (at least Cisco ones) do not allow you to ssh into virtual devices by default, which makes it nearly impossible to use network automation tools like Ansible. Of course, you could extend the virtual network into the real one, but at least in my environment it would create lots of other issues with security and other teams.

My solution to the problem - write a proxy server in python, which will receive SSH connection from Ansible and proxy them to the virtual device. I have written some very basic script a couple of years ago and used it for some small testing, then somebody else turned the script into a linux service and just recently I added some code to handle CMLv2 lab (where there are no telnet ports exposed anymore, instead you have to SSH into the CML host and type ""open virtual\_device\_id"" to open console connection to it).

You can find code with install instructions here - [https://github.com/eoprede/ssh\_to\_telnet\_proxy](https://github.com/eoprede/ssh_to_telnet_proxy)

As an example, here's how I start script in my environment: 

    /usr/local/bin/ssh_to_telnet_proxy -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3000 --cml my.cmlv2.com --logfile /var/log/ssh2telnet.log

And this is how my ansible inventory looks like, when I am connecting to one of the virtual IOS devices:

    test:
      hosts:
        ""ssh2telnet.proxy.com"":
      vars:
        ansible_connection: network_cli
        ansible_network_os: ios
        ansible_user: gesha24@/ecf1dd/n1/0
        ansible_password: password
        ansible_port: 3000
        ansible_become: yes
        ansible_become_method: enable

After that I can run pretty much any playbook against a virtual device and verify it performs as expected.

Abstract from Radware 


A newly discovered botnet targets TCP port 8291 and vulnerable Mikrotik RouterOS-based devices. MikroTik, a Latvian hardware manufacturer, products are used around the world and are now a target of a new propagating botnet exploiting vulnerabilities in their RouterOS operating system, allowing attackers to remotely execute code on the device. Such devices have been making unaccounted outbound winbox connections. Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) has spotted an increase in malicious activity following Kaspersky’s publication about the Slingshot APT malware that infected Mikrotik routers. It is believed this botnet is part of the Hajime botnet. Radware is witnessing the spreading mechanism going beyond port 8291 into others and rapidly infecting other devices other than MikroTik (such as AirOS/Ubiquiti). The concern is that this new botnet will be leveraged to launch DDoS attacks

apumsu,networking,1549986406.0,"I've recently been working on an interesting problem that I wanted to share: **how to monitor and analyze network capacity usage**. I was brought onto the problem because we face a difficult challenge in Optiver–our business is driven by financial markets, which can unexpectedly become busy when, for example, major news events occur. When these market spikes happen, applications across our network suddenly try to send data as quickly as possible to financial exchanges across the world where we trade. These synchronized flows can then collide, overloading the capacity of our network equipment, leading to packet drops and long delays as the entire system needs to retransmit data. These delays can be very costly – packet drops can cause delays of multiple seconds in distributing our theoretical prices, far longer than the timescale at which markets move today.

[Image 1: Example of incoming packet rates on a logarithmic scale to three machines (solid lines) vs historical baselines (dashed lines) around the US market open (15:30 Amsterdam) and an unexpected news event (\~17:05)](https://lead5194.s3.amazonaws.com/content/uploads/files/document/image2019-1-25_15-37-45.png?mtime=20190211170440)

From an infrastructure perspective, there are two ways we could try to solve this problem. On the one hand, we could make a **major investment in the capacity of our infrastructure**, buying new network switches with deep buffers, additional network lines, etc. On the other hand, it wasn't clear whether we were **using our capacity wisely**–for a long time, many people in the company had assumed our core infrastructure had infinite capacity. The process of gathering the data to check how we used our capacity turned out to be a very interesting and exciting project.

## Gathering the Data

When I started this project, I was new to the world of network monitoring. Thankfully I work with a lot of talented engineers who were happy to teach me about the equipment we used, the metrics they thought were important, and what sort of data we could extract. We already had a lot of operational data on the load on our Unix machines and switches, and knew that **many of our systems were highly loaded**. However, the biggest **missing piece was insight into what traffic was flowing over the network**. We set out to gather new data to address this question.

One way to see what is traveling over the network is to directly tap and record the traffic. We already use tapping extensively to keep track of exactly what data we send and receive from exchanges. For routine monitoring of our broader production trading network, however, this approach does not scale easily – we use 10 Gbps networking equipment nearly everywhere, which would lead to huge amounts of traffic to store and process. Thankfully, in the networking world, switch vendors have come up with two competing services to provide **scalable monitoring of network flows**: **Sflow** and **Netflow**. Both of these services run on switches, which then report information on their flows to a server. Sflow works by taking **random samples of the overall traffic** passing through the switch and forwarding those packets to the reporting server. Netflow reports statistics on individual flows, summarizing, for example, that a flow from one IP and port to another carried N packets with a total size of S over 1 second. However, many implementations of Netflow also allow random sampling of packets like Sflow, making the two services largely similar in practice.

We have a **heterogeneous networking environment** at Optiver, which led to some challenges: many of our switches supported Sflow, but some others only supported Netflow, and others didn't support any packet reporting services! As a **result, we had to handle both services**. In the end, the team I work with built a **custom packet proessing agent in C** to capture the packet reports from switches, batch the results, and forward them in a more standardized JSONL format. These **JSONL packet reports were then imported by a Python Flask-based microservice** that stored the records in a **custom Postgres database**. An important advantage of this architecture is that the packet processing agent allows us to collect metrics from switches in remote datacenters without overloading the limited network capacity between them.

The initial trials of this architecture resulted in a **LOT of data to handle**. 10 Gbps of traffic corresponds to up to 125 million packets per second. At the most frequent sampling rate supported by our Sflow-capable switches (1 in 65535 packets), that is still up to **2000 sampled packets per second**. Netflow without sampling produces a record per flow (IP-port source/target pair) per second, with a typical switch seeing **tens of thousands of distinct flows**. We currently collect data from **\~30 switches** and want to expand this to the hundreds of switches in our environment, so managing this data required carefully deciding what we wanted to see and fine tuning the parameters.

The biggest challenge with this flow data was that the **most traffic is not interesting** – flows that occur rarely or with low numbers of packets generally don't strain our environment and need our attention. Unsampled Netflow, however, was in our case dominated by these sorts of flows, producing massive amounts of uninteresting data and slowing down the overall system. Sflow, on the other hand, could be used to provide good average statistics over longer time periods and by its nature focuses on the biggest flows. The trade off is that it is difficult to zoom into specific events since packets are rarely sampled. In the end, we settled on using the **most frequent sampling rate for Sflow (1 in 65535 packets)**, which generally gave us enough packets to analyze in relevant time windows for major flows, and the **least frequent sampling rate for Netflow (1 in 1000 packets)** to reduce the amount of data reported.

## 

## Integrating Datasets

This sampled packet data provided a lot of insight into what our network was doing, but it was **hard to directly turn it on its own into actions our engineers could use to improve the infrastructure**. What does it mean to see that a switch reported a handful of sampled packets from one IP and port to another IP and port? The data would also have different meaning to a network engineer than an application engineer. To make it easier to interpret this data, **we integrated the raw packet metrics with metadata on IPs and ports**. We found several types of metadata relevant:

* **Physical connectivity:** what switch an IP is connected to and in which datacenter is the machine
* **Machine info:** hostname, interface, and functional name
* **Applications:** labeling IP-port pairs with applications using our production application monitoring service
* **Traders:** a lot of traffic goes to the Windows workstations of our traders, which we could label with their usernames

It was actually **quite a bit of work to gather this metadata**, since it was **scattered across many isolated teams and exposed in different ways** – git repositories, REST APIs, Microsoft SQL databases, and Postgres databases. We also wanted to track this data over time, since our production environment changes frequently and we would analyze flow patterns over longer timescales. In the end, we built a set of **Python daemons** that regularly poll these datasources, saving records in a **custom Postgres database** on the time ranges in which a set of metadata associated with an IP and port were valid.

This imported metadata turned out to be a useful dataset on its own, so **we kept it as a separate microservice**. In the process we ran into a common problem with microservice architectures – **how to deal with distributed data**? I didn't want to reimplement the data model yet again, so I took advantage of Postgres's ability to add tables from **remote Postgres servers** and **imported a view** from this metadata microservice. In the end, we were able to **convert raw networking metrics into something more generally usable by people across the company**, as the data was now labeled clearly with servers, applications, and even users.

## Data Visualization

## 

## Time Series KPIs

In Optiver, we widely use the **time series database Influx** to store operational metrics for the whole company and display them in custom dashboards with **Grafana**. In order to let application engineers directly track the relevant metrics, I wrote a small script to query the Postgres database and **export daily application traffic metrics** to Influx (which was now possible thanks to the labeling with the application metadata!). We could then easily track long-term trends in how much traffic different types of applications were sending. It also revealed one of the first big insights – one particular class of applications, involved in distributing theoretical pricing data for our trading systems, was always at the top of the list of which applications sent the most traffic. We also saw over the course of the project that this class of application was also one that could easily breach our capacity limits with new releases or configuration changes.

[Image 4: Grafana dashboard showing the outgoing traffic recorded for two applications over a month, with a noticeable uptick after a new configuration was deployed.](https://lead5194.s3.amazonaws.com/content/uploads/files/document/image2019-1-25_15-2-44.png?mtime=20190211170438)

While it made sense to us that theoretical pricing data would be some of the bigger flows in our systems, we also saw some surprising things: for example, theoretical pricing components that distributed data to GUI clients often used more bandwidth than the ones that sent critical data to remote datacenters. What we really needed to see was **where these flows were going**. Of course, that data was in the database we built, but we needed a tool to make it easy to investigate these issues. Grafana is very useful for letting people make custom timeseries visualizations, but it is very **difficult to natively visualize relationships** in data there. We also frequently use **Jupyter Python notebooks** for interactive data analysis work within Optiver, but this network flow dataset was **too large to easily interactively explore in a notebook:**

## Building an Interactive Data Visualization Webapp

I realized to quickly solve ongoing problems with this network flow dataset, what we needed was a way to **interactively click through the data**. I needed to **dynamically control what level of aggregation I showed the data**, as well as the **hierarchical structure in the flows** (datacenters → switches → functional names → hosts → applications). In thinking about the problem, I was inspired by many of the great data visualization examples from the **D3 framework**. In addition, from my work on a previous project within the company, I was impressed by the data visualization results you can achieve with a **custom webapp in the Javascript framework React**. I decided to build a D3-style network visualization in React of this dataset, with dynamic aggregation and highlighting of the network flows.

Within Optiver, we have been using the **Redux framework** to structure our React applications. In Redux, the application state is modeled as a central store that is updated in a deterministic way by **reducer functions** that process **action objects**emitted by React components. In addition, since this webapp needed to fetch data exposed by web APIs within the company, we built a custom asynchronous reactive data-fetching process with **RxJS and Redux-Observable** that handles data fetching actions and emits data received or error actions upon completion. The actual visualization part is then handled by **React components**, which are either classes with some local state and a render method or pure functions. These components use their properties (and local state) to render to other components and eventually HTML. React then takes care of updating the browser with the desired view.

In integrating D3 with the React/Redux architecture, there are some competing ideas that make it **hard to directly copy example D3 code**. The original architecture of D3 used the concept of **binding HTML elements to data** and expressing the properties of these HTML elements as **functions of the data**. D3 would then take care of adding, removing, or updating the browser elements as necessary. In my opinion, the React approach of mapping from data (React properties) to HTML with **pure functions is much more elegant** than the D3 method in which you must define how to handle creating and removing elements. However, D3 has a lot of **powerful visualization functions**: convenient mapper functions, for example to normalize numerical scales, turn numbers into colors, and calculate SVG paths. Most importantly for the visualization I needed, it also has a powerful library to create dynamic network visualizations with a **force simulation**.

I therefore integrated the two libraries by writing a **stateful React component** that ran a D3 force simulation, saving the positions from simulation state to the React component, and then rendering a visualization based on the data and current simulation state. The actual visualization part could be written in a standard React way, with components for nodes and links in the graph that render based on their properties (data). I also used D3's useful helper functions to control the styles on the rendered elements. I wrote functions to convert the labeled flow data into a node per hierarchical level with the aggregated flow between each node. The React component also maintained state on which node was highlighted and/or being dragged. For the force simulation, after much experimentation, I settled on using a **combination of forces to make a good layout**: I used standard collision and charge forces with link strength a function of the aggregated flow data to generally arrange the nodes and links. I added a centering force to keep the whole network in the middle of the page, and a radial force to arrange each layer of the hierarchy at increasingly far out circles. Dynamic aggregation of the data was handled at the Redux level: I added actions and reducers to handle the concept of ""bundling"" flows, which resulted in dynamic aggregations of the raw data.

# What We Learned

* Before we began this project, **it was hard to get application engineers to act on networking performance issues**. The problem is that it wasn't easy to assign responsibility – it already took quite a bit of manual work to convert an IP into a machine. **Once we labeled the data with application names, people immediately took interest.** In particular, we found developers were very interested to see how their applications were behaving in the production environment.
* The networking equipment we bought in the past was driven by networking performance requirements. As we built this dataset, we realized an unintentional trade-off: some switches at interesting locations in our network were lacking in analytical features that we now found very useful. As we look to buy new networking equipment, **monitoring capabilities will be high on our priorities**.
* The labeled network flow data revealed **many deployment issues due to the constantly evolving production environment** – there were proxies in incorrect locations, applications that send TCP to growing numbers of clients in remote parts of the network without proxies in between, and closely communicating applications located in different server racks that needed to communicate across the core network. With this data now regularly available, we are looking at **recommending automated optimal deployment configurations** based on network traffic patterns.

This will make firewall configuration and audits much simpler. Each department will fall into one of the two. So I plan to give a /24 to each department, plus a /24 each for network equipment, servers,  surveillance system, etc.

What this means is that I would have many /24 VLANs, routed by a core layer 3 switch. Some of the /24s will only have a few devices on them. The reasoning is to contain broadcasts and any virus/ransomware/etc.

ad7hn8,networking,1546795117.0,"I've had a hellish weekend after one of our VPN sites in Shanghai went down, I'll call it site A. Site A has a standard internet circuit provided by China Unicom and was originally set up with an IPSEC VPN to our Hong Kong data centre where it could utilize our global MPLS. We had latency problems with that VPN, so instead set up a new tunnel to another site in Shanghai, site B, which had its own MPLS feed and that worked great up until yesterday.

The WAN address we use at site A ends in .203, but since yesterday we were seeing ESP discards coming in from .205. I tried moving the VPN back to our DC in Hong Kong but were seeing ESP discards from .205 in the logs on the ASA at our Hong Kong DC. I turned NAT-T on, which didn't resolve the problem, but had this log entry on Site A:

    Automatic NAT Detection Status: Remote end is NOT behind a NAT device **This end IS behind a NAT device**

We hooked a laptop directly up to the ISP router and when doing a whatsmyip, found that it was different to the public IP we had statically configured on the laptop. Even if we changed the IP on the laptop to .205, it was NAT'd again to something else in the /29 they provided us.

China Unicom insist they are not NATing us, but we've tried an ASA and a direct laptop and are seeing a different IP everytime. Because of this we can't VPN anywhere, and this site is completely cut off from our MPLS.

Give this python script an IP address of a root node and SNMP read-only credentials, and it will do the rest.
  
Version v0.10 is now on [github](https://github.com/MJL85/mnet).  
  
**Change Log**

    v0.10 - 5/5/2018
    	- Ported to Python 3
    	- Cleaned up and refactored code
    	- Improved discovery
    	- Improved discovery console output
    	- Fixed VSS chassis detection; now finds correct serial# and platform
    	- All output referencing node IP now uses best IP instead of first found
    	- Try all known IPs for a node until one works; no longer fails on unreacable IPs (eg, VRFs/ACL blocks/etc)
    	- Default depth is now 100
    	- Added runtime to stdout
    	- Renamed 'graph' to 'diagram'
    
    	- Cisco ACL-style node matching (replaced config subnets/exclude with discover)
    	  - Added 'leaf' option to stop discovery beyond a matching node
    	  - Added 'include' option to stop discovery at a matching node
    
    	- Config option diagram/node_text replaces the below:
    	  - include_svi
    	  - include_lo
    	  - include_serials
    
    	diagram
    	- Changed -f option to -o
    	- If a LAG spans multiple devices (eg, Nexus) override expand_lag for that device
    	- Output can create multiple files. Ex: -o ""file.{svg|png}"" will create file.svg and file.png

Google is hitting us with Captcha's on just about 1/3 of all searches performed from our public IPs. They're saying that they've identified a ""malicious search extension"" from our public IP but cannot provide us any information about what that is. They cannot tell us the extension name or any information about the computer is originating from. All they have said is ""it's your responsibility to find it and stop it.""

It could be an extension a student has installed when they're not signed in with our gsuite accounts. We have no control over that. Now google hasn't been able to tell us the number of search queries that triggers this, the time frame, or any other helpful information.

Their stance has been a hard ""you figure it out."" I asked if they could whitelist our public IP while we try to identify the cause because it is causing serious trouble for my elementary students (they don't know what a captcha even is!), but their response was (and I'm copying this directly from the email), ""cannot whitelist your public I.P addresses, since that would leave us open to a possibility of bringing down the main-frame.""

Let me start by saying while I am techy, can troubleshoot, etc. I am a little over my head right now. Currently our business network is on a 50mbps down / 10mbps up plan with our ISP. We are experiencing some delays when it comes to using our VOIP phones and when needing to do zoom meetings, etc.  We were given the all clear from upper management to upgrade our plan to Gigabit. The issue with that is the current switch is limited to 100mbps up and down and therefore would need an upgrade too in order to handle the upgraded speeds.

The price we were quoted was $22,000 CAD (about $17,500 USD) This does not include any new cabling as the building has cat6 and cat5e network cables through out. What is does include is:

* Meraki MX105 Cloud Managed Security Appliance
* Meraki MX105 Advanced Security License, 3 Years
* Meraki 1 GbE SFP Copper Module
* Meraki 10G Base SR Multi-Mode
* Meraki MS120-48FP Switch L2 Cloud Managed 48PT GBE PoE
* Meraki MS120-48FP Enterprise License, 3 Years
* Meraki MS125-48FP L2 Stackable Cloud Managed 48X GigE

* Meraki MS210-48FP Enterprise License, 3 Years
* Meraki 10 Gb Twinax Cable with SFP+ Modules, 1 Meter
* Meraki AC Power Cord for MX and MS (US Plug)

I'm assuming this is because of the number of connections coming from a single address. And there is some kind of automatic blocking on the streaming sites end. I did some quick google-fu and even chatted with a basic support rep at Amazon but I can't get anywhere.

Does anyone know how I would get these sites to unblock our IP block? Or how to reach out to an actual admin over there instead of a customer support rep?

Turns out it was, as many suggested, actually our content filter causing the issue. Our filtering solution, Securly, uses proxies like other cloud filtering options. And while the ""Streaming Sites"" category was not blocked in our policies since we use ssl decryption it was still going through one of their proxies. So to circumvent that I added the domains to the global allow list. Now when that dns request is made the traffic goes directly to the site instead of being proxied.

I've always hated PowerConnect, but I had an opportunity to build a new business for Dell in the networking field. I've always loved Force10 and when they were acquired while I was building the services business, I was delighted. I was not as fond of SonicWALL, but it grew on me. I am very familiar with Dell's networking business so this all surprises me.

I'm currently working in a completely different industry, but still as a network engineer. We are upgrading our Internet circuits to 1 Gbps and found that a location with 100 Mbps is currently running a firewall with a 10/100 interface. So we are shopping around, looking at three vendors to replace that device; Palo Alto, Check Point and Dell SonicWALL. Palo Alto and Check point have sent a sales/engineer team onsite and have ordered us a ""demo"" unit to use at our disposal. I had to track down who to talk to at Dell and was assigned a salesperson in AZ (we are in Austin, TX).

First contact took almost a week after filling out the webform to have someone contact us. I got on the phone and talked to this guy, telling him I have some questions about number and types of interfaces, IPS throughput, type and number of CPU cores, etc. His response made me consider that I was being ""Punk'd"". I was told that I could search in ""the Google"" and I could find all that information. Interesting, I hadn't thought of that /s.

Next request I had, was a Dell whitepaper or PowerPoint that compared SonicWALL to Palo Alto or Check Point. He told me about this awesome website he found ""about a week ago"", firewalls.com, that compared any firewall to any other... Ok, I'd be interested to take a look, but what I was specifically looking for was Dell collateral to help us out in our comparison. According to him, ""Dell doesn't have any whitepapers or anything like that...""

Lastly, I asked what it would take to get a demo unit sent out to us, but I was told that SonicWALL doesn't allow that for security reasons. If they ""send us a firewall and we infect it with a virus and then they send it to another customer"", that would be bad. OMG! I really thought at this point this dude is fucking with me... Guess, not; he sent me a link to a demo site that I had already visited that doesn't allow you to make any changes to the device at the other end.

Two days later this guy calls me back; I almost didn't answer, but I did. He had no recollection of calling me two days before. I just told him we were working with a reseller...

This would be lightyears easier if I was able to do these configurations through the CLI, rather than a web interface since it would mean I could simply take the list of objects, rules, etc from the old running config and alter the CLI syntax to that of FTD and past the list in, but unfortunately it seems like Cisco has limited the usability of the CLI for configuration in a means to force you to use one of their multiple, but all horribly un-intuitive web GUIs.


The new CLI, oh wait did I mention there are 2? The FXOS for system configuation, and the FTD for ""everything"" else. By ""everything else"" I mean that is looks like you can only do some basic interface configurations, static routes, ( but no dynamic protocols) and some other items. Why did Cisco seem to have dumbed everything down in the new line of Firewalls? It's incredibly frustrating as an engineer to not be able to use the CLI as a legitimate means of configuring.

7ryanw,networking,1516548760.0,"Was doing some Saturday night maintenance last night (yay... fun.)

Part of the maintenance involved moving our Internet circuit to a different router.  We unplugged from old router, and moved the circuit to the new.

BGP came up right away, and we learned the default route from our provider, and a 'show ip bgp neighbor advertised routes' shows we're sending the correct prefix.

But Internet access was hard down.  (Yes we're a smaller company without pi ip space, without our own asn.  Yes I've been complaining and saying we needs isp redundancy but told they won't pay for it.)

Anyway, traceroute to Google goes all the way to the new router and dies there.

We go over the configs hard looking for anything we got wrong... but everything looks right.

Then we start looking at netflow and see our traffic is very clearly egressing, but no return traffic is coming back from the ISP.  Doing 'show interface human-readable' confirms this as input packets is practically nothing pretty much just the bgp keep alives.

It's like they black holed us.  And on the bgp looking glass of course you can only see the super net advertised by our isp, so there's no way to see if they're getting our smaller advertisement.

At this point we call their noc but it's painful talking to their Saturday night crew as they can't understand what the problem is ""you're not accepting our route, you're not sending return traffic"" is completely alien language to them, and they just bounce us back and forth between two desks.

While waiting to actually get someone everything just starts working.

We had bgp debugging turned on, and nothing happened when it started working.  Not a single syslog threw on our router.  But now return traffic is coming in and everything works.

Our isp closed the ticket with no info and their noc manager said ""you can call back Monday but I'm just saying, you're not going to get an RFO because we never saw anything wrong, and once I get off the phone with you, we aren't going to look at this any further.""

787qnb,networking,1508765637.0,"Working with an HP Procurve 5400. I have ACLs setup, however they're not working the way I thought they worked. What I'm attempting to do is stop our student vlan from accessing another vlan.

Student network = 10.124.0.0/16
example network they shouldn't access = 10.121.0.0/16

    # ip access-list extended StudentWifi
    # deny ip 10.124.0.0/16 10.121.0.0/16

    # permit ip any any
    (applying it to the student vlan)
    # vlan 124
    # ip access-group StudentWifi in

My issue is I can still access webUIs on the 10.121.0.0/16 network. I cannot ping those devices from the student VLAN (but can from others) so I know my ACL is working for ICMP, but not for http/s.

38dvh9,networking,1433347293.0,"My company is currently looking for a solution for graphing our network utilization of our firewalls, switches and routers. We've been looking at the usual solutions (Nagios, Zenoss, etc) but I decided to check out Observium since I've read a lot of good things about it here. I installed it a couple days ago and I have to say overall I've been pretty impressed with it. Dead simple to set up and it looks pretty nice as well. However, it definitely lacks the ability to customize some things and that's where my story starts.

Our shop is a mixture of Brocade and Cisco gear. While Cisco creates a port channel interface for LAGs, providing an easy way to see aggregate bandwidth over the links, Brocade does not. With other graphing solutions we've tried we've able to combine graphs of the interfaces involved in the LAG and everything is just peachy. I was trying to see if I could do this with Observium so I went to the IRC channel to ask about this. Here is the IRC transcript of our conversation (for reference, adama_ is Adam Armstrong, the founder and lead developer of Observium):

[08:56am] landono: Does Observium have the ability to combine graphs to show LAG connections? On my Cisco switches we have portchannel interfaces and this works great with Observium. However, on my Brocade boxes, when you create a LAG group it doesn’t create its own interface. I’m trying to create a single graph that would show the bandwidth over the aggregate, so if I could combine graphs that should do the trick. Is this possible?

[09:02am] adama_: landono: obsevium isn't designed to allow lots of fiddly bullshit

[09:02am] adama_: so no

[09:02am] sid3windr: well

[09:02am] SysX: it displays what it gets from snmp

[09:02am] sid3windr: you can do that just fine actually

[09:03am] sid3windr: just not in a supported way in the gui

[09:03am] adama_: not without fiddling horribly

[09:03am] landono: Lots of fiddly bullshit? Really?

[09:03am] landono: Seems like a pretty simple thing to do, but that’s the answer I need. Thanks

[09:04am] adama_: yes, manually configuring aggregate graphs because your idiot vendor was too stupid to do it for you, is fiddly bullshit

[09:07am] landono: not really, but thanks

After this, I get banned from the channel. I was informed by another user of the channel whom I was private chatting at the time that he then posted:

[""09:29:15] <@adama> condescending fucktardery will get you banned""

I am blown away by the lack of professionalism here. Yes, my last comment was a bit condescending, I admit I was frustrated at the time, but I can't see in any way how it merits a response like this. After talking to this other user I found that this seems to be the norm with Adam. He linked me a forum post that shows what Adam has said about WISPS in this same IRC channel a couple months ago https://community.ubnt.com/t5/The-Lounge/AFMUG-What-Adam-Armstrong-of-Observium-thinks-of-WISPS/td-p/1219320.

The sad thing is that I was just about to pull the trigger on buying the professional version of Observium. Even without the aggregate support I felt that it provided most of what we were looking for in a monitoring solution. Obviously after this there's NO way he'll get a dime from us. I do think that Observium is a really good product but those of you who are looking to pay money for it, especially if you think you're looking for feature requests and support, please take the time to consider the person you'll be giving money to and the level of professionalism he'll provide.

The best way I've come up with to test if Viasat is blacklisting an IP from a non-Viasat connection is to try and ping one of the core routers such as 64.125.54.230.

Their blocking is also implemented in a very strange way, if you try and connect to a blocked IP address from a Viasat connection every TCP port will accept your connection but do nothing other than accept whatever you write to it and eventually time out after no activity(I assume some box on Viasat's network is intercepting and responding to all TCP connections going to blacklisted IP's).",https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/bupiek/psa_viasat_is_aggressively_blacklisting/,PSA: Viasat is aggressively blacklisting Digitalocean IP addresses,,112,58,0.95

Sorry if this has been asked a million times.

I'm quite new to BGP, I know that iBGP doesn't change attributes mainly the next hop. How do Large ISPs generally configure their BGP networks?

Would they have hundreds of routers within an iBGP AS, using route reflectors, changing editing the next-hop IP and injecting null routes to bring the BGP prefixes into the routing tables

Or do they have hundreds of small iBGP AS's with 5-6 routers inside all linked together using eBGP?

The first way was how I did my EVE lab, but was getting tricky/lot of work to implement (around 15 routers).

Or do they have another method that I haven't thought of?

Make no mistake, I'm not saying we should all give up using Proxy Minions, but I do realize that an always running service might not always justify its cost. As an user, I've experienced this too at my last two employers: I would definitely use Proxy Minions to manage the edge of the network (or anything that is highly dynamic), but there was always the question in my head: how can I manage those devices that we don't regularly touch - for instance console servers, or CPEs of a service provider network?

After years of looking into this challenge, the solution was much easier than I thought, and today I'm happy to open source salt-sproxy: https://github.com/mirceaulinic/salt-sproxy
In brief, salt-sproxy is a Salt plugin that allows you to manage network devices (but not limited to), without the constraint of running thousands of Proxy Minion services -- simply install and start automating straight away.

The complete documentation is available at https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and I would invite you to take a closer look to better understand how to use and what are the available features. As it's relying on Salt, you would still need to be familiar with the Salt fundamentals, so if you haven't worked with Salt before, check out this list of articles to get a better understanding: https://github.com/mirceaulinic/salt-sproxy#prerequisites.

For a general overview, I've also wrote a blog post on this, which you can read at https://mirceaulinic.net/2019-06-17-minionless-salt-automation/.

If you'll find this useful, remember to start it on GitHub and why not Tweet about it, or share it with your friends: https://github.com/mirceaulinic/salt-sproxy.

I'm very much looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this, and learn from your experience. I'm offering this completely for free, and I'm documenting everything I think it may help you. If there's anything missing or unclear, let me know. As a growing community, it's in our best interest to be open and communicate feedback, because that's how we can improve.

Focused on port capacity at the access layer but didnt take bandwidth into account or port capacity at the dist and core. Didnt plan for any expansion.
When asked which IGP I would use, I didnt have an answer. I feel like EIGRP, OSPF, ISIS are all protocols I understand how they work, how to work with them, however I am missing the Why and When to use them.
I guess I am looking for help answering WHY I would use x over Y instead of how to use them.
