zeo31j,sysadmin,1670375697.0,"About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially ""good with computers"" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.

But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.

Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and ""nothing is going to happen, you worry too much""

So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.

And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 

So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said ""I quit,"" I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job.

Transitioning the environment to Windows 10. All the new computers with Windows 10 have been issued but, much to my horror, management decided to allow the users to keep their Windows 7 computer ""in case something went wrong.""

Well after 6 months of telling people that all Win7 will get blocked on 1 Feb and my SCCM/PDQ reports showing that people are obviously ignoring that, I got the go-ahead to kill all of Windows 7........ After confirming all objects moved to the ""YOU NYA"" OU with the ""ME MYA"" GPO linked, I walked away with the biggest grin on my face.

I will definitely update this post tomorrow with the aftermath of my little ""D-Day"" but just to clarify, I did query how many of these 2,400+ objects were actually pingable just before I left and only 500-ish replied. The plan was to delete the objects as users turned in their old workstation. Still though, I do not envy our help desk tomorrow. Cheers!

Before the storm edit:

Wow this blew up! Lots of assumptions here. We're not a private company, this is public sector and we have a very public mandate from our cybersecurity branch that everyone must be on Windows 10 by today. It was signed acknowledged and distributed by our top official over a year ago (Including this culling of all Win7 devices). There is no possibility of a roll back. I'd like to go into the details of all that we did to prepare but that would be a wall of text. Suffice to say, its been a shit show from day 1. While I made help guides, slides, an entire wiki site, site wide emails describing in detail what's going on... site visit reports and exchange logs shows most of my transition efforts went into the trash. 

I'm just glad we're finally turning this corner so I can go back to having just one workstation OS to worry about.

**The edit you all deserve:**

Alright, so I am in fact, STILL EMPLOYED! Shocking what happens when you do things with buy-in from your IT director.

It wasn't the blow up we all feared would happen. We had a few grumbles here and there but mostly everyone who call the help desk went, ""Oh you mean we have to start using the new computers now???? WHAAAAT!? Oh fine..."" Yesterday began with a meeting with the director, deputy director, help desk supervisor, the lead sysadmin, the project manager, and myself. The Director had already talked to the other department heads and got a list of no no-shit cannot go down Windows 7 computers (5 in total). The lead admin had compiled a list of domain joined special appliances that ran Win7 that couldn't go down which was about 100. That all got thrown into own special mini OU with all the GPOs they need to operate. The rest of the Win7 environment got dumped into an OU where log on is denied to everyone. If someone calls the help desk because they absolutely needed the one file, the help desk tech was to move them to an OU where Applocker blocked access to MS Office, all browsers, and PDF readers, literally the only thing they can do is burn their crap to DVDs or run the robocopy script they've been staring at for the last 6 months that would back up their entire profile, if anyone is interested, here is the robocopy line (there's some more flair we put in the script but this is the meat)

    robocopy %userprofile% \\backupserver\share\%username% /e /b /copy:DATSO /r:0 /XD Appdata /Log:%userprofile%\desktop\copylog.txt /NDL /NS /NP

All the user had to do in order to migrate was double click BACKUP.BAT on their desktop, wait for it to finish. Then log on to their already issued Windows 10 computer and run RESTORE.BAT (same as above but in reverse) on their desktop and wait for it to finish, then they're done! A little launch outlook and auto-discover your email here, a little import PST there... The base Windows 10 image already has most of all the line of business apps everyone uses. And for those who needed something unique installed, all they have to do is ask to have it reinstalled and the tech would put their new computer name in appropriate SCCM collection (but by this point we had already covered most everyone in this scenario). I spent the first six months of this year long plus project getting the image and imaging process down pat, as well as the creating the new AD structure and GPOs that is replacing the old Win7 environment which looked like an aborted senior project from a IT based high school. Every department had already received their replacement computers since before Christmas, all they had to do was turn it on and double click the backup/restore scripts.

Anyway... all that detail aside, with all of this prep work done, the migration was a piece of fucking cake, users panicked and held off for no reason. They were able to easily switch with very little effort once they were forced to. I didn't get fired, boss is happy, users are relieved and (mostly) happy, I'm happy and we're able to continue on our little lives. We have a few minor hiccups with some websites and java issues but nothing unusual from the normal java/website issues, some machines have to get re-imaged because some people didn't even take their new computer out of the box for months (despite very explicit instructions to immediately connect it online even if they didn't want to use it) so it sat stale in AD and missed some critical updates/changes. By the end of the day, we all agreed that it was no more unusual than a typical day and not the raging hellfire burning down around us we expected would happen. We were well prepared to handle any calls that came up and I got quite a few high fives. There will NOT be a roll back.

fu4261,sysadmin,1585899517.0,"In September 2018 I made a business case for how we should move away from a random mishmash of aging desktops and monitors, and get the entire company onto a modern, mobile-friendly IT-platform. A laptop for everyone - even if they won't actually be traveling, new monitors, and new peripherals for those who wanted it.

Initially it was a bit of a struggle, but with the help of a bunch of TCO calculations put into C-level friendly bar graphs we finally got approval, and got working.

In June 2019 we were done. The entire company had been moved to spiffy new laptops. Everyone had dual monitors at 24"" or lager. Everyone had the option to take their laptop to a meeting, to a conference, or home, and continue working *almost* as if they were still at their desk.

9si6r9,sysadmin,1540853648.0,"It's been a few weeks since our little incident discussed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9mk2o7/mri_disabled_every_ios_device_in_facility/).

If you didn't see the original one or don't feel like reading through the massive wall of text, I'll summarize:A new MRI was being installed in one of our multi-practice facilities, during the installation everybody's iphones and apple watches stopped working. The issue only impacted iOS devices. We have plenty of other sensitive equipment out there including desktops, laptops, general healthcare equipment, and a datacenter. None of these devices were effected in any way (as of the writing of this post). There were also a lot of Android phones in the facility at the time, none of which were impacted. Models of iPhones and Apple watches afflicted were iPhone 6 and higher, and Apple Watch series 0 and higher. There was only one iPhone 5 in the building that we know of and it was not impacted in any way. The question at the time was: What occurred that would only cause Apple devices to stop working? There were well over 100 patients in and out of the building during this time, and luckily none of them have reported any issues with their devices.

In this post I'd like to outline a bit of what we learned since we now know the root cause of the problem.I'll start off by saying that it was not some sort of EMP emitted by the MRI. There was a lot of speculation focused around an EMP burst, but nothing of the sort occurred. Based on testing that I did, documentation in Apple's user guide, and a word from the vendor we know that the cause was indeed the Helium. There were a few bright minds in my OP that had mentioned it was most likely the helium and it's interaction with different microelectronics inside of the device. These were not unsubstantiated claims as they had plenty of data to back the claims. I don't know what specific component in the device caused a lock-up, but we know for sure it was the helium. I reached out to Apple and one of the employees in executive relations sent this to me, which is quoted directly from the iPhone and Apple Watch user guide:

>***Explosive and other atmospheric conditions:*** *Charging or using iPhone in any area with a potentially explosive atmosphere, such as areas where the air contains high levels of flammable chemicals, vapors, or particles (such as grain, dust, or metal powders), may be hazardous. Exposing iPhone to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals, including near evaporating liquified gasses such as* ***helium***\*, may damage or impair iPhone functionality. Obey all signs and instructions.\*

Source: [Official iPhone User Guide](https://help.apple.com/iphone/12/#/iph301fc905) (Ctril + F, look for ""helium"")They also go on to mention this:

>*If your device has been affected and shows signs of not powering on, the device can typically be recovered.  Leave the unit unconnected from a charging cable and let it air out for approximately one week.  The helium must fully dissipate from the device, and the device battery should fully discharge in the process.  After a week, plug your device directly into a power adapter and let it charge for up to one hour.  Then the device can be turned on again.* 

I'm not incredibly familiar with MRI technology, but I can summarize what transpired leading up to the event. This all happened during the ramping process for the magnet, in which tens of liters of liquid helium are boiled off during the cooling of the super-conducting magnet. It seems that during this process some of the boiled off helium leaked through the venting system and in to the MRI room, which was then circulated throughout the building by the HVAC system. The ramping process took around 5 hours, and near the end of that time was when reports started coming in of dead iphones.

If this wasn't enough, I also decided to conduct a little test. I placed an iPhone 8+ in a sealed bag and filled it with helium. This wasn't incredibly realistic as the original iphones would have been exposed to a much lower concentration, but it still supports the idea that helium can temporarily (or permanently?) disable the device. In the video I leave the display on and running a stopwatch for the duration of the test. Around 8 minutes and 20 seconds in the phone locks up. Nothing crazy really happens. The clock just stops, and nothing else. The display did stay on though. I did learn one thing during this test: The phones that were disabled were probably ""on"" the entire time, just completely frozen up. The phone I tested remained ""on"" with the timestamp stuck on the screen. I was off work for the next few days so I wasn't able to periodically check in on it after a few hours, but when I left work the screen was still on and the phone was still locked up. It would not respond to a charge or a hard reset. When I came back to work on Monday the phone battery had died, and I was able to plug it back in and turn it on. The phone nearly had a full charge and recovered much quicker than the other devices. This is because the display was stuck on, so the battery drained much quicker than it would have for the other device. I'm guessing that the users must have had their phones in their pockets or purses when they were disabled, so they appeared to be dead to everybody. You can watch the video [Here](https://youtu.be/5Cvdyt-KZHk)

We did have a few abnormal devices. One iphone had severe service issues after the incident, and some of the apple watches remained on, but the touch screens weren't working (even after several days).

I found the whole situation to be pretty interesting, and I'm glad I was able to find some closure in the end. The helium thing seemed pretty far fetched to me, but it's clear now that it was indeed the culprit. If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability. Thank you to everybody to took part in the discussion. I learned a lot throughout this whole ordeal.  

&#x200B;

**Update:** I tested the same iPhone again using much less helium. I inflated the bag mostly with air, and then put a tiny spurt of helium in it. It locked up after about 12 minutes (compared to 8.5 minutes before). I was able to power it off this time, but I could not get it to turn back on.

tay9bg,sysadmin,1646917561.0,"So  five years ago I was laying on my back in pain wishing someone would  shoot me after sliding off a church roof we'd been shingling.  I was 25  with shit insurance, 2 kids, a pregnant wife and making 28,000 a year.   That night while lying on my back stone still after taking 4 Advil I  decided there has to be a better way to make a living than this.

I  spent a couple months asking around for any job when one of my buddies  was like check out IT.  Then he goes on like ""man we spend half the day  talking and bitching about stuff, then we go to lunch and have meetings.   This job is gravy and it pays great!""  He wouldn't tell me how much he  made but mentioned making 45k his first year in it.  I'm thinking, well  shit sign me up!

It took me about  a year to get up to speed.  I bought a cheap laptop from Walmart and  every night after work was on YouTube watching videos and practicing.   And let me tell you, I was a complete novice.  Like at the time I had a  smartphone but used an actual computer maybe once or twice a month and  that was to get on the internet.  I couldn't tell you the difference  between Chrome and Notepad, that's how little I know about computers.

But  I stuck with it and four years ago was hired at a hospital doing PC  support.  Pretty basic stuff like hooking up desktops or helping someone  with software the best I could.  Starting pay was 48k.  When they asked  me if that was reasonable I about fell out of my chair.  I'm thinking  hell yeah and insurance finally.  I still spent most every night  studying, I upgraded to a better desktop and started to dabble in cloud  technology (Azure at first).  The hospital provide Pluralsight training  that I started using for training in more advanced stuff (my boss told  me I had more hours logged than everyone combined).

Exactly  one year after I started at the hospital I walked in my managers office  and gave him my two weeks notice.  He said he figured this day was  coming and shook my hand the last day (we still go fish together).  Next  Monday I started a new job as a Linux administrator making 83k a year.   I remember logging in Workday at least a dozen times that week just to  look at that number.  83k, is this number correct?  Did the company make  a typo?  Never did I think I'd be making this kind of money in my life.

My  last goal was to get into security with a focus on cloud.  I did slow  down on the training after work to spend more time with family and I was  getting burned out from pushing so hard.  Plus we were finally able to  take family vacations, and wear new clothes while watching Netflix on a  huge TV together (that means a lot when you didn't have shit for your  family just a few years ago).

This  week I started my new job at a new company with the title  Associate  Security Engineer with my focus on web services.  I am making 110k.  I  don't even know how to feel about that but I like it!

(Also  I know I spoke a lot about money but this is a really fun career and I  do enjoy the challenge.  I don't even bitch about stuff that much.)

I  started this post to ask about salaries in IT but went off on a tangent  about my career.  I'm still in shock how high the pay is in this  industry and the thought does stay in the back of my mind are these  salaries going to last?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/tay9bg/four_years_and_im_still_shocked_by_the_salaries/,Four years and I'm still shocked by the salaries in IT.

I'm right in the middle as a millennial and do not look forward to kids half my age being like ""what is a folder""

But at least we can all hold hands throughout the generations and agree that we all hate printers until the heat death of the universe.

**edit**: some bot DM'd me that this hit the front page, hello zoomers lol

I think the best advice anyone had in the comments was to get your kids into computers - PC gaming or just using a PC for any reason outside of absolute necessity is a great life skill. Discussing this with some colleagues, many of them do not really help their kids directly and instead show them how to figure it out - how to google effectively, etc.

This was never about like, ""omg zoomers are SO BAD"" but rather that I had expected that as the much older crowd starts to retire that things would be easier when the younger folks start onboarding but a lot of information suggests it might not, and that is a bit of a gut punch. Younger people are better learners generally though so as long as we don't all turn into hard angry dicks who miss our PBXs and insert boomer thing here, I'm sure it'll be easier to educate younger folks generally.

I found my first computer in the trash when I was around 11 or 12.

xj87kv,sysadmin,1663678878.0,"A while back I posted this thread about this stupid policy my employer has enacted where ""work from home"" means you have to work at your HR-registered street-address.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wbmztl/what\_asinine\_work\_at\_home\_policy\_has\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wbmztl/what_asinine_work_at_home_policy_has_your/)

And now, in the words of Paul Harvey, it's time for the Rest Of The Story.

Today, I found out why this policy was enacted.

A few weeks ago in a meeting with HR, the HR rep made a comment about the policy being enacted because people weren't working at their houses but were taking 'vacations' (unapproved) and ""working"" while on vacation.

Digging around a little with my friends high up in central IT admin, it seems a senior administration official who never uses a computer was participating in a zoom meeting. In the zoom meeting, one of the participants was apparently at the beach participating in the meeting remotely.

Except, she wasn't.

She had her zoom background set to the ""tropic"" theme with the palm trees and ocean in the background.

The moron thought she was participating remotely from Aruba or some shit. He wanted to bring her into HR on disciplinary charges but didn't know her name because zoom has pretty pictures of you and he didn't get her name (or maybe she had edited her setup to just show her first name, who knows).

Based on that, the wheels start grinding where we need a new policy where everyone has to work ""at home"" when they work from home or you're considered AWOL.

When someone finally realized what happened, and brought it to his attention, senior IT people got involved (which is how I ended up finding out about it).  They explain the zoom background to him. Rather than admitting his mistake, he doubles down with how the policy is ""necessary"" and becomes even more vested in making it a reality (rather than admitting his mistake and looking like a complete moron).

No. I'm not shitting you. This is not urban legend territory. I'd laugh if it weren't so stupid.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I'm wondering if I can use this new policy to my benefit when I am ""on call"". If I can't ""work"" from anywhere other than my HR-registered street address or I'm considered AWOL, I guess this means when I am on call and not home I do not have to answer my phone/emails, since I would technically not be working ""at home"".

Coincidentally, the same HR person got a phone call from a headhunting service that asked if she had gotten their email, and how they've tried to send it three times now. 

&nbsp;

I did a message trace in the O365 admin center. Shared some screenshots in Teams to show that the emails are reporting as sent successfully on our end, and to have the user check again in junk/spam and ensure there are no forwarding rules being applied. 

&nbsp;

She immediately questioned how I ""had access to her inbox"". I advised that I was simply running a message trace, something we've done hundreds of times to help identify/troubleshoot issues with emails. I didn't hear anything back for a few hours, then I got a call from her on Teams. She had her manager, the VP of HR in the call.

&nbsp;

I got reprimanded because there is allegedly ""sensitive information"" in the subject of the emails, and that I shouldn't have access to that. The VP of HR is contemplating if I should be written up for this ""offense"". I have yet to talk to my boss because he's out of the country on PTO. I'm at a loss for words.

UPDATE: I've been overwhelmed by all the responses and decided to sign off reddit for a few days and come back with a level head and read some of the top voted suggestions. Luckily my boss took the situation very seriously and worked to resolve it with HR before returning from PTO. He had a private conversation with the VP of HR before bringing us all on a call and discussing precedence and expectations. He also insisted on an apology from the two HR personnel, which I did receive. We also discussed the handling of private information and how email -- subject line or otherwise is not acceptable for the transmission of private information.

That said, I attended company dinner today. Before the meal, the CEO and the higher ups thanked the whole staff  for the successful last year. 
The junior CEO started with some basic things and then suddenly goes: "" and we got a letter in our complaint box. I want to read it to you"". For those who don't know what a complaint box is, it's a box where you can file complaints anonymously. 
I was shocked when the Junior read the message out loud and the first thing she said was my name.
My whole body tensed up. 
Then she continues ""I want to thank you for your help. You are always kind and you solve all my problems. I whish the company would give him a extra reward""

I was not expecting that at all. It never happened to me before. It gets even more surreal. As the clapping the toned down, service department leader stood up and said: ""On that note, i want to add that he is alone at the moment and has a shit ton of work but he even worked late yesterday because I needed him to set up something for me""

This feels so great. Some people actually do care for and notice the effort I put into my work. 
I think this will be forever engraved in my memories.

He slipped up in a casual conversation and mentioned a minor piece of information that wasn't terribly confidential itself, but he could have only known by having accessed information he shouldn't have.  

I picked up on it immediately and didn't tip my hand that I'd noticed anything but my gut dropped.  I looked at his ticket history, checked with others in the know to make sure he hadn't been asked to review anything related...and he hadn't.  It was there in black and white in the SIEM, which is one of the few things he couldn't edit, he was reading stuff he 100% knew was off-limits but as a full admin had the ability to see.  So I spent several hours of my Thanksgiving day locking out someone I have worked closely with for years then fired him the next morning.  He did at least acknowledge what he'd done, so I don't have to deal with any lingering doubts.

Folks please remember, as cheesy as it sounds, with great power comes great responsibility.  The best way to not get caught being aware of something you shouldn't be aware of, is to not know it in the first place.  Most of us aren't capable of compartmentalizing well enough to avoid a slip.  In an industry that relies heavily on trust, any sign that you're not worthy of it is one too many.

*edit* Some of you have clearly never been in management and assume it's full of Dilbert-esque PHB's. No,we didn't do this to screw him out of his bonus. This firing is going to COST us a hell of a lot more than $10k in recruiting costs and the projects it set back.

It is policy that IT limit interaction with the folks in our programs because we lack the prerequisite training for safety, medical and Human Rights. 

I get a call from a residential manager that they are setting up a new TV that one of our residents just purchased for themselves. It was a simple ""join this network, heres the password"" situation while I approved the connection on my end and opened up web traffic. The manager on the phone just could not follow my instructions. She didnt know how to use the television remote, so I sent her step by step instructions with photographs and talked her through it. She couldnt use the onscreen keyboard, I talked her through that as well. We finally got the point of entering the wifi password and she just couldnt do it. No amount of coaching could get her past this final hump. It looked like I was going to have to take an hour drive just to enter a wifi password, that is until I heard Mike in the background. 

Mike is the gentleman who purchased the TV. He said he can help get it setup. It also turns out Mike is a technology hobbyist, he likes to build computers in his room and has his own homelab setup. Mike talked at length about digging into Pfsense, building out his domain and setting up his own network for his room. You could hear the excitement in his voice. After we chatted for a while we got his new TV setup and he thanked me for talking with him about his computers. The manager got back on the phone totally aghast. Mike didn't engage in that way with anyone. She explained Mike has fairly severe Autism and has a hard time communicating. Mike isn't non-verbal but he generally doesn't speak to verbalize his needs or interact much with staff or housemates. She couldn't believe he was talking so fluently and clearly with somebody outside his mother (who visits often). That's when it hit me. Here's this guy who has so much to give and say but he didn't have anyone to interact with. All alone in his room trying to do what he loved but nobody to share it with. I made a fast exit to my car and started crying almost as soon as the door closed. I am still broken up about it. 

It feels so good to know that I helped this guy even just by talking to him. I am making a suggestion to my boss that Mike be added to certain IT projects, even if its just simple stuff like recycling computers or password resets.

At the top of the Enterprise sign up form (which is a Google Form for fuck sake) there is this statement:

> DISCLAIMER:
This is an Enterprise API tier application, which enables continued access to v1.1, v2 and additional Enterprise APIs. **Pricing starts at $42,000** / Month based on usage and needs.

The digital signage widget only supports the v1.1 API  and the basic tier only gives access to v2 as far as I can tell. 

We also got notification from our web host that they are removing the twitter feed widget from their CMS.  Apparently the quote they got from twitter to cover all of their customers would have required them to charge EACH CUSTOMER $10K PER MONTH.  To display the last 10 tweets on our website.  GTFO.

Either Elon is actively trying to destroy twitter or he's so out of touch that he thinks companies are going to pay what amounts to extortion.

a1iffo,sysadmin,1543506284.0,"I know I’m not alone in getting many cold calls/e-mails daily from new vendors. It always seems to be that the vast majority of these are a huge waste of time, and go unanswered. From a corporate IT perspective that hears from vendors all the time, I’ll explain why that is (at least for me).

1. We get tons of vendor calls/e-mails. 10+/day is an underestimate.
2. When I do answer the call, you provide little to no information about your product. You’ve got about 1 minute of time to convince me before I hang up on you. If I answered the phone at all, consider yourself lucky. If I ask a question, you better have an answer. Be prepared. Example of how these calls usually go for me:
   1. **Vendor:** I’m XYZ vendor do you have a minute?
   2. **Me:** Not really.
   3. **Vendor:** We help with software procurement and represent XYZ companies.
   4. **Me:** What is your pricing on XYZ licenses if I buy x count?
   5. **Vendor:** We need to setup a call to discuss pricing.
   6. **Me**: Can you ballpark it?
   7. **Vendor:** We like to setup a call to….
   8. **Me:** \*click\*
3. When you send an e-mail, it contains nothing useful at all. I’m not going to setup a call for you to learn more about my company. You already scalped my information from LinkedIn or other sources, you already have an idea of what we do, what I do, etc. You have a blank slate. Putting a pile of fluff accomplishes nothing. Examples of bad contacts:
   1. *The meeting invite with no prior contact:*
      1. **Vendor:** “Hi, I’d like to learn more about your company is 2:30PM tomorrow good?”
      2. **Me:** Who the hell are you? Delete.
   2. *The vague e-mail:*
      1. **Vendor:** “Hi we help streamline helpdesk workflows for many customers is that something you’re interested in?”
      2. **Me:** What does that even mean what are you selling? Delete.
   3. *The less vague e-mail but doesn't have anything useful inside:*
      1. **Vendor:** “Hi I am from XYZ company and we have this super awesome firewall product”
      2. **Me:** We have one of those. Delete.

What does work? We had a vendor do this recently that worked really well and we have bought a lot of product from them as a result of their initial interaction. Here’s how it went down:

1. **Vendor e-mail:** “Hi, we are a major toner distributor. We have OEM and reman toners. Here’s a price list attached of common printer toner prices. We can offer significant savings over the attached list if you buy more product or use any of our additional services”
2. **Me:** Hmm…this is cheaper than what we get now. Let’s buy a few for our next deployment.
3. **Vendor:** Hi, are you enjoying our product? We can offer competitive pricing on printers too. Here’s some pricing for printers based on the toner you just bought.
4. **Me:** Hmm…this is a better deal.

&#x200B;

Why did this work?  The vendor was up front and direct about what they sell, what they do, what their pricing is, etc. We now buy all printers and have a toner subscription through this vendor. All as the result of a cold e-mail.

&#x200B;

Please stop wasting everyone's time. Be direct, be upfront, and stop beating around the bush about what it is you’re trying to accomplish.

&#x200B;

Edit:  Thanks for the gold, silver, comments, etc.  Didn't expect this to take off like it did.  For those vendors and others that are commenting about ""just shopping for price"" and such, you're missing the big picture.  Toner company wanted to sell toner, but they don't really care about selling toner.  They care about establishing the relationship to sell other products.  Toner gets their foot in the door.  Now it's easy for them to sell service contracts, printers, copiers, etc.  You're not going to establish a relationship easily with a vague e-mail or a $100k product out the gate.  $500 of toner is little risk for everyone involved and establishes a relationship.  If toner company opened up with ""we have Lexmark and HP service contracts for a fraction of the competition and would love to meet and discuss your business needs!"", then that would have been dumped with the other junk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/a1iffo/vendors_stop_wasting_my_and_your_time_with_bad/,Vendors: Stop wasting my (and your) time with bad cold calls,General Discussion,5328,1090,0.95

Second night, I get a frantic call from my boss saying ""our monitoring server is down, nothing is working, I'm getting alerts on my phone"". He doesn't know what to do. I use my mobile 4g hotspot and laptop and remote in to have a look.

Turns out a web service for the monitoring system had locked up. The alerts it sent were for the system itself, everything it was watching was fine. I restarted it, and everything's back again. I summarize it, tell him how to fix it, go to hang up, and boss tells me the CEO wants to talk to me in person about this since he received notifications as well. I tell him I'll send a debrief via email on what happened, and that it wasn't critical. No. Has to be in person. They both know I'm 4 hours away. I told them this before I left. I tell them again. Doesn't matter, need ""to speak to you directly in the morning"". Won't take a phone call.

So I drive 4 hours back at 3am, fully prepared to quit on the spot because this is bullshit. Get there at 7, CEO is not in his office. Have to wait an hour for him to come in. He finally shows up, says that he's ""concerned about the reliability of our systems"". I tell him it was a single service that locked up, that no production services were affected and that I fixed it remotely. Asked him why he thought it was okay to pull me all the way here for this. He counters with ""well we wouldn't have approved your vacation had we known there would be service issues in your absence"". He wants a complete report typed up on what happened, and wants me to present it to him in a meeting at 1PM with the rest of the lead staff. Fuck my vacation I guess.

I'm currently sitting in my office not believing this is actually happening over a single stopped web monitor that was back online 10 minutes later, and that didn't even affect any actual services. I'm tempted to walk just for the CEO's shitty attitude alone, but I can't risk even short-term unemployment at this point.

What would you do? How would you handle this?

It all started with an acquisition of another company we'll call them the insane asylum that basically makes software for our industry. I am going to vaguely say my company is in the manufacturer world and buying the software gave us a competitive advantage. Of course no senior executive thinks about the difficulties the IT teams are now faced with in a meager. The first sign of something being amiss is when me and my coworkers were provisioning laptops and computers for employees from the insane asylum and we asked for requirements for each department. Everything seems to be going fine until I see the request from the insane asylum's development team. They wanted 40 laptops each with 4 TB of storage, which is a hell of a lot for a work computer and could send them way over budget. I couldn't understand why they needed that much local storage so I called up the head of that department for an explanation and his team danced around why they need that much storage. I mean we pay for cloud services for a reason, basically we walked away with the team telling they would try to make it work with less storage but never elaborated on why they requested it in the first place. I walked away from that phone call confused and my co-worker who is Jamaican (not relevant except that he uses local colloquialisms that wind up being very funny later in this story) brought up that their behavior seemed bizarre like why on earth would they plead the fifth when we pressed them for questions, we're honestly just looking to help. But work was piling up and even though we hadn't been involved in the acquisition they had passed audit before we purchased them so I let it go.

I was beginning to think they had snails or something typing at the computers.

Something very weird is going on with the new dev team. Their app is suffering intermit outages, slow responses, and network monitoring says they are seeing that team trying to move GB's of data on the network. Call them ASAP.

&#x200B;

My poor colleague calls the team and things really start to unravel they tell him many of the insane asylum old IT folks were let go during the acquisition including the guy who was responsible for increasing their storage when their app was close to hitting space capacity. They  had assumed we had been doing it in his place. No problem he could request a new virtual server or additional space in amazon to mitigate the problem right now and we could come up with a long term plan once I got back to my desk. The person he's talking too immediately cuts off and says that isn't necessary they just need him to call drop box support. He's now very confused and asks why on Earth are they sending or storing information in drop box that's a huge breach. He asks what information the app/website is pulling from the drop box and they drop a bombshell they tell him the entire database is in drobox. At this point I'm told he began to look like he just stumbled out of the trenches in 1917. He asked them to elaborate because what they described didn't sound possible. It was but it wasn't just the database it was the entire app and website. The app was actually just a server instance in Heroku that was spun up whenever there was an update and would make crazy api calls to the drop box account read information from hardcoded database files. He immediately called drop box support to figure out what in god's name was going on and to his horror after several escalations gained access to the account and found that the account had 497 TB of 500 TB space used up and the team was on the verge of running out. This explained why they needed such large hard drives and why they changes were taking so long it would take days to upload and download so much data  to drop box plus have all the devs resync their local drop box instances with the correct latest versions. This single drop box account was also their version control.

&#x200B;

My colleague perhaps prophesying that a tsunami of shit was about to be unleashed started screaming the blood of Jesus, the blood of Jesus, lord no the blood of Jesus which might be the Caribbean equivalent of holy fucking shit. Unfortunately, the CISO happened to be in the room and was concerned why one of her employees was having a break down or if she should start preparing for the second coming. Usually I look to put together bullet points and work actions before contacting the CISO in an emergency because she often doesn't see the nuances of day to day operations. When this was all explained to her from street level her head exploded. Meanwhile I'm falling asleep in a meeting completely ignorant of the impending hurricane of shit I'm about to walk into until an analyst stormed into the meeting like Pheidippides right before he collapsed after the battle of marathon. He told us there was a potential privacy breach the CISO was already aware without being briefed and on top of everything else since the technical leads were in this doomed sales meeting all the zoo animals were let loose in the office. My blood runs cold and we all rush downstairs to a three ring political circus, our CISO is trying to justify to the CFO and the insane asylum employees that this is unacceptable even if we get this back online and increase the drop box storage this is a ticking bomb and we need to start an emergency investigation to see if anyone former employee or hacker has accessed this drop box account. There is zero monitoring in place and they were sharing accessing willy nilly with the whole team. Every team member had read/write access. Weary of losing this political battle and forcing her team to support this beast she went with the nuclear option and emailed the general counsel explaining the risks. This is when shit really started to roll because she interrupted the lovercraftian cosmic horror otherwise known as general counsel's vacation to lob this turd grenade. I spent of all night coming up for a solution to migrate all this information  and try to confirm that there hasn't been a data breach yet. I would have been working the following morning as well but I was in so much pain when I woke up on top of having anxiety nightmares the whole night, I went to the doctor and found out I have a stomach ulcer I can't be certain but I'm pretty sure this whole incident plus intervention from IT demons pushed my body over the edge.  The solution is yet to be determined it’s a miracle I haven't shot a developer yet.

&#x200B;

There's a lot of lessons to unpack here but to this day it blows my mind what glue stick and  thumb tact solutions are in production. I'm concerned there are tons of companies out there were the standard operating procedure is too have stuff collecting  electricity without anyone knowing what it is or how it works.

&#x200B;

P.S. my son said I should write that I'm hopping my fellow IT veterans pour one out for me this weekend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*Update number 1\*\*\*\*\*

1.We are paying to upgrade the storage in drop box I am not happy about this but we're not going to win friends for this battle if we come off as mules unwilling to offer a solution.

2. The cost of this much drop box storage is tens of thousands. I just found this out via an email  but the CFO is not clear in the message if its per year or per month (more unlikely)

3.  We are having four people work over the weekend to go through the data and understand whats going on. (You better believe they are making time and half)

4. I'm concerned there was data leak or breach and so is legal. We are still putting together a way to track who accessed what historically. I'm praying we don't find anything malicious.

5. If its a situation were we don't any historical information or logs. Legal is considering accepting that we can't assume integrity and will send a notice to customers.

6. Audit has some explaining todo.

7.  I'm taking a few days to deal with my ulcer and get an abscess in mouth cleared up (may have been a result of the ulcer) . This problem is not  going to be magically programmed away so I fully expect it to be waiting for me when come back to the office in a few days.

8. My email and phone are ringing off the chain

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*Update number 2\*\*\*\*\*

1. I feel bad because peoples holidays are begin interrupted but a shit show is never convenient.
2. Upping the storage has not resolved all the issues and were still on high alert.
3. Two of our senior devs not insane asylum employees (also making time and half one of the gave up a vacation day) are getting involved to start documenting this mess this is  not my cup of tea  I don't make web applications so this is over mine and some of the security staffs head.
4. Both Devs can't believe they did this. One is only 26 or 27 and can't believe in this day age someone would think this is a proper version control system. The older colleague is from the Soviet Union and told us the only shit storm he remember even being remotely as bad was when he in university/army service right as communism was falling apart and he had to work with a computer in Russian, software written in his local language, and software guides written in English. Longest year and half of his life apparently.

\*\*\*\*Update Number 3\*\*\*\*\*

1. The soviet has come up with a plan I just spoke to him over the phone a few hours ago. He already got the storage increased but thats doesn't fix all the other issues. He's going to freeze updates and have people download the latest version of each file manually onto a virtual server then commit this to a private git repo. This is an extremely time consuming and tedious annoying task but it will get the job done god help the poor folks that draw the short straw on this assignment.
2. We have a post mortem /come to Jesus moment with this dev team on Monday. I will not be attending as I'm sick but the Soviet, the CISO, and my manager the head of IT operations, and a very technical associate will be there to get a lay of the land. The Soviet also told me if there is push back or if they start getting cold on giving him direct access to the drop box instance he's going to shoot someone (I don't think he's kidding) he had to work on a Saturday because of these people.
3. My Jamaican co-worker is fine  he'd probably get a kick out of everyone's concern. But people tend to overreact/ get worked up when security is involved.
4. Investigation is on-going there is some serious concerns. This companies old IT ticketing system was turned off / decommissioned  I jumped through hoops to get the archive out of a landfill. Apparently they have an IT ticket from a year half ago where an ex employee tried to delete files which is concerning not a big concern but trying to figure out if for instance an employee left the building after downloading dropbox files to their home computer is ongoing. There is a lot of security implications to unpack.
5. It appears to be an enterprise drop box account this is unconfirmed but  a consumer account I hope wouldn't be possible. What concerns is that some people were all using the same account the drop box instance and others created accounts and shared access with those accounts. People never cease to amaze.
6. The devs also told me there is some serious hackery going on with these web app  it probably has a bunch of vulnerabilities but beside that it has not just flat csv files its querying for info but also fully functional sqlite database which probably accounts for the poor performance on top of everything else they implemented sqlite incorrectly.

\*\*\*\*Update Number 4\*\*\*\*\*

1. I think one day perhaps I'll write an IT lessons learned / horror story collection book. I'm not sure if people would actually read it.
2. I do have more stories to share and I have glad certain seem to enjoy how I write but I do think this is should be a serious discussion board and tend to make my post more question/serious oriented. Even when I have a funny horror story I try to point out the serious implications and lessons learned. Not sure if there's a subreddit where my stream of consciousness musings would be a better fit.
3. Antibiotics make a world of difference when you have a stomach ulcer.

\*\*\*\*Final update\*\*\*\*\*

1. The Soviet has not shot anyone
2. Keep in mind I keep all my rage pent up and than unleash it via writing. While all this was happening I kept a calm demeanor and just kept looking for solutions and not panicking. It makes a world a world of difference when trying to win people to the logical side. But keeping my frustrations too much has affected my health negatively I need to work on not taking things so seriously
3. Permanent solution will a bridge too far at least for another month or two and its the holidays right now. Everything is in git repo now and a transition to real solution is underway. The non soviet senior dev will be holding a psychology class on how this group all came to the conclusion that a 500 TB dropbox was a fine a solution.
4. We found things considered to be sensitive in the account were still working  through it with drop box to figure if it was 
5. I will consider doing another  write up of the another ridiculous fire we are putting out that is still in progress. This has been a very difficult year for my company's IT staff I am glad its almost over.  
6. I am considering writing up a short collection of my IT horror stories will need some time to consider it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/eaphr8/a_dropbox_account_gave_me_stomach_ulcers/,A Dropbox account gave me stomach ulcers,,5071,599,0.98
ahme8l,sysadmin,1547907237.0,"So my company (large multinational) gets High end laptops for its workers and gets the 3 year premium warranty, after 3 years the laptops are data wiped and then either retired (recycling), Given to the employee to keep or stored for subcontractors and interns. 

So we are in our replacement cycle right now and the new laptops are top of the line i7 16gb 1080p screen NVME 512GB SSD laptops. 

Were talking about 1.5-2K U$D laptops, 

And they are absolute shit

**Dell**

- Already had users complain about bent hinges no fix there.    
- the Ethernet port is absolute trash, i was running PXE to load the corporate image and on about 20% of the laptops unless you pushed the RJ45 all the way in with the force of the damn hulk it would give issues and disconnects.   

- A few were overheating and out of curiosity i opened one, excessive use of thermal paste and the paste for the processor was like dry Playdoe which i had to manually scrap off the cpu, once cleaned up and re pasted with proper paste i had a 30 degree C drop at rest and 15 at load... is this a joke ? dell is using some Shenzen special dollar store thermal paste on 2000 dollar laptops ?  
- We have 3 year premium warranty and they keep fighting us on details like ""yes, you have download and install our proprietary Windows iso and install that and rerun all the tests""... on a laptop thats 90c at rest inside the bios,  We just bought close to a million dollars in laptops with premium warranties from you and you want me to tell a user i have to wipe all his data so dell can fix his overheating laptop ?

- Dell in Raid mode for Intel Rapid storage + PXE = BSOD  

**Lenovo** (this is supposed to be the highest rated Laptop manufacturer)  

- HDMI starts to work intermittently or stops working all togather at times, only solution is to press the Reset hole at the bottom of the laptop with a Sim tool. (thanks to lenovo i always have one on me) , I have a possible solution but i was like ""why the hell would you route the HDMI exit through the Thunderbolt?""   

- Keys are falling off, a 2 grand laptop with 2 weeks of service and people are coming to me with keys coming off the laptop, WTF ?    

- Reviews state 12h batteries, real life experience puts it closer to 6 hours, i have not been able to get one of these to run for more then 4.5h on battery power, and i have users coming to me complaining and i have no answer for them, 

- They ALL overheat but they stay below the 105c thermal limit (havent had one go above 98c), i understand the laptop is thin and light but i cracked one open to see whats going on. 
The CPU was ""stained"" with thermal paste, it was more like they put a drop and thats enough, and only on the CPU core, the controller die next to it HAD NO PASTE on it. Who the hell is building these laptops ? 

Im just burned out and had to vent, 2 grand laptops i should just be able to set up with our PXE servers and hand to our users and they are giving us so much shit...  we´re not talking about 300 buck AMD E2 or Intel N4100 laptops off gearbest, these are top of the line laptops which people and companies pay good money for with the simple idea is that they are well built and made to last, and im seeing laptops which will probably start showing serious failures in months.

8mmu1h,sysadmin,1527475441.0,"Last week my ex-boss reached out to me about cleaning up a ransomware infection that had taken down his servers (ones that I helped set up years ago). We'd known each other for 18 years and we had worked at multiple jobs together. We were close friends. He was my mentor and I might possibly have been the closest thing he had to a son.

After sharing a bunch of advice to help him with the ransomware infection, I thought he had it under control. He'd successfully restored at least a few of the affected servers from snapshots and the rest he could just do the same way.

He did not have it under control. He felt like a failure. He felt like he'd let everyone down. He had cancer and was in constant pain. The sleep deprivation and the stress from working the outage for multiple days had affected his judgment in profound ways and I had no idea.

At 4am this morning he posted a farewell message on Facebook and then he took his own life.

I'm posting this because I know that there are a lot of us here that regularly get into stressful outage situations. It is a statistical certainty that some of you at some point will not be able to save the day. I want to say to anyone who will listen that when that happens to you, it is OK. I don't care if it's total, catastrophic failure that leads to the company shuttering or innocent people dying. It is OK.

I want to tuck it in the back of your head that you are intrinsically valuable, as you are right now, with or without a career, and no matter how bad something at work gets, you are loved.

When you are in over your head, sleep deprived, and not thinking straight, I want you to remember that in the end, the company and your fellow employees will take care of themselves, and you are entitled to take care of yourself too. Admit failure. Walk off the job if you have to. Take a medical leave if you need it. Call someone you can confide in, whether that's someone close or a total stranger.

IT people notoriously have bad people skills, and it's the number one cause of outsiders disrespecting IT people. It's also a huge reason that we have so little diversity in this industry, we scare away people who are less knowledgeable and unlike us.

The only reason they even have anything is I convinced the owner to at least let me come in and do a manual backup 6 months ago.

edit 1 - im not posting pictures.  need to see what HR is doing. again, I’m in risk. This is a risk at this time. 

Edit 2 - the lunch time report. Normally to contact HR there is a form yada 24-36 hours yawn. I’m IT. I walk into HR and do some “follow ups”. I pull a “oh by the way can I get your opinion on”.  HR person said that they will investigate to see if there was any access to my digital file in the past whatever time period. HR human commented that is unusual but things that come here are normally strange. Mainly HR is here to protect the company, which it should. They told me to send them video (I did) and any communication paper trail (I did). I guess we wait.

Edit 3 - the night time report.  They concluded that nothing was accessed recently by them or anyone in their department so it's pretty much case closed on the HR side.  They suggested that nothing internal was compromised.  HR can be there if I want a witness to ask them yo wtf.  HR always rolls with an internal company PO (we have our own police force, too, in case of incident).  I am starting to think this lady is just a weapons grade dolt.

Yes, an app from the Chinese government needs to be installed in order to fill out the application.

What will happen though, we are putting a clean install of windows on an old laptop, not connecting it to our network and giving it a wifi connection on a special SSID that is VLANed without a connection to a single thing within our network and it is the only thing on the VLAN at all.

Then we can install the app and he can do what he needs to do.

\--Long Story Short--

Owner insisted on 0 downtime. Moved the server 700 feet on a cart with 2 UPSs and a chain of (3)gigabit switches.

Should have been a 5 minute job if done correctly. Owner ended up paying for over 10 hours of work.

\--Long Story Short--

[\[FAQ\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/i4bi9i/faqrant_sorta_physically_moved_a_server_today/)

Stupidest thing I've ever had to do.

One of my clients bought a new office space in the same complex and wanted their 1 virtual host server(7 Windows VMs) moved to the new ""server room"". At first, I thought, ""Awesome! This will be quick. I'll just shut everything down, remove, number, and pack the drives, move everything, and set it all back up. Couple hours tops.""

(Yesterday)

Nope... I started going over my plan with the owner and he stops me at the first step:

>Owner: Wait, we can't shut anything down. We have customers accessing that server all day.  
>  
>Me: You didn't notify them of scheduled maintenance like we discussed on Friday?  
>  
>O: No, we can't have any downtime.  
>  
>M: There is going to be downtime.  
>  
>O: If there is, I'm not paying you.  
>  
>M: Ok, there is a way I can do it but it will be about 5 minutes of downtime. We can set up a new virtual host at the new location and migrate through a temporary VPN.  
>  
>O: Absolutely not! No downtime!  
>  
>M: Ok, bye.

A few hours later, a friend of mine calls me up and says, ""Hey, I have this client that needs a server moved. He says he usually has you do his IT but you refused this time?""

I tell him the story and we agree on a plan that will move the server and get both of us paid well.

(Today)

I met up with my friend at the office and we got to work. From closet to ""server room"" is around 700 feet so we got 3 lengths of cat6 and 3 switches. We plugged the switches into our trucks in the parking lot and connected them with the cat6.

After the necessary DNS updates for the external services and the successful setup of the new firewall, we set up 2 of the NICs on the server as failover and plugged in a cat6 from the parking lot. After unplugging the original cat6 and a few minutes of testing and we confirmed not downtime yet.

Next, we unplugged 1 of the 2 power supplies and plugged it into a rackmount UPSs that was on the cart. Again, no downtime yet.

We then unplugged the other power supply and, extremely carefully, moved the running server to the cart. We plugged the other power supply into a second rackmount UPS also on the cart.

Then began the fun part. Just over 2 hours to, very carefully, push the server to the new office space. On the way, changing the NIC failover at each switch.

At the new office space, we successfully mounted everything back up. Tested for a while and confirmed 0 downtime.

Friend charged the client for 4.5 hours of work, 2 hours of consultancy, and 4.5 hours of consultant help(Me).",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/i3xbjb/rant_sorta_physically_moved_a_server_today/,[Rant... sorta] Physically moved a server today...,Rant,4541,746,0.98
xda3jr,sysadmin,1663081794.0,"Over the last week, I have seen a lot of requests coming across about testing if my company can assist in some very large corporations (Fortune 500 level, incomes on the level of billions of US dollars) moving large numbers of VMs (100,000-500,000) over to Linux based virtualization in very short time frames.  Obviously, I can't give details, not what company I work for or which companies are requesting this, but I can give the odd things I've seen that don't match normal behavior.

Odd part 1: every single one of them is ordered by the CEO.  Not being requested by the sysadmins or CTOs or any management within the IT departments, but the CEO is directly ordering these.  This is in all 14 cases.  These are not small companies where a CEO has direct views of IT, but rather very large corps of 10,000+ people where the CEOs almost never get involved in IT.  Yet, they're getting directly involved in this.

Odd part 2: They're giving the IT departments very short time frames, for IT projects.  They're ordering this done within 4 months.  Oddly specific, every one of them.  This puts it right around the end of 2022, before the new year.  

Odd part 3: every one of these companies are based in the US.  My company is involved in a worldwide market, and not based in the US.  We have US offices and services, but nothing huge.  Our main markets are Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, with the US being a very small percentage of sales, but enough we have a presence.  However, all these companies, some of which haven't been customers before, are asking my company to test if we can assist them.  Perhaps it's part of a bidding process with multiple companies involved.

Odd part 4: Every one of these requests involves moving the VMs off VMWare or Hyper-V onto OpenShift, specifically.  

Odd part 5: They're ordering services currently on Windows server to be moved over to Linux or Cloud based services at the same time.  I know for certain a lot of that is not likely to happen, as such things take a lot of retooling.

This is a hell of a lot of work.  At this same time, I've had a ramp up of interest from recruiters for storage admin level jobs, and the number of searches my LinkedIn profile is turning up in has more than tripled, where I'd typically get 15-18, this week it hit 47.

This machine is typically a production server that is running an OS years out of date (since I've worked with Linux flavored machines, we'll go with that for the rest of this analogy). The mystery server is usually introduced to you by someone else on the team as ""that box running important custom created software with no documentation, shutdown or startup notes, etc."" This is a machine where you take a peek at top/htop and notice it has an uptime of 2314 days 9 hours. This machine has faithfully been running a program in htop called ""accounting_conversion_6b"" 

You do a quick search on the box and find the folder with this file and some bin/dat files in the folder, but lo' and behold not a sign or trace of even a readme. This is the machine that, for whatever reason, your boss asks you to update and then reboot. 

""No sir, I'd strongly advise against updating right now -- we should get more informa.."" 

""NO! It has to be updated. I want the latest security patches installed!""

A guy named Greg 8 years ago wrote a program to convert files from <insert obscure piece of accounting software that is now unsupported because the company is no longer in business> and formats the data so that <insert another obscure piece of accounting software here> can generate the accounting files for payroll.

And then, at the insistence of a boss who doesn't understand how the IT gods work, you apply an update and reboot the machine. The machine reboots and then you log in and fire up that trusty piece of code -- except it immediately crashes. Sweat starts to form on your forehead as you nervously check log files to piece together this puzzle. An hour goes by and no progress has been made whatsoever.

And then, the phone rings. Peggy from accounting says that the file they need to run payroll isn't in the shared drive where it has dutifully been placed for the last 243 payroll cycles.

""Hi this is Peggy in accounting. We need that file right now. I started payroll late today and I need to have it into the system by 5:45 or else I can't run payroll.""

One of our SQL developers sent an email this morning to a few people in our office (here in the US), the CIO, and the CEO (both in Europe). It was an oddly written email but he went on to say that he was a casualty of the Management practices in our company (referencing the downsizing of IT/IS and the perpetually growing workload placed on our shoulders).

The email was obviously significant for political reasons but the wording left many of us concerned. HR quickly buttoned it up and kept things quiet all day, but I just learned that he killed himself this morning shortly after sending that email. There’s more to what happened but the investigation is ongoing and I’m also trying to be sensitive.

He was an office friend. We’d worked on a lot of projects together and have gone out to lunch a number of times over the 7 years I’ve been with this company. Personally, I’m feeling a little lost right now, and I’m having a tough time reconciling the guy I knew against the news of his passing.

I’m writing this, not only to try and process the grief but to bring up something that does not get enough attention, especially in our line of work. Being in IT, in any capacity, is very often thankless and demoralizing. Many of us are expected to constantly do more with less time and for less money, among other things. In that sort of environment, it’s very easy to fall victim to depression and suicide.

If this is you, please don’t remain silent. You are worthwhile and your story deserves to be told by you. There are people in your life that care and, wherever you are, there are people who want to help.

z6304t,sysadmin,1669560531.0,"So a week ago Friday I gave my two weeks notice after finding a new, better position. I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). 

I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. 

Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap.

8inzn5,sysadmin,1526047447.0,"**Introduction**

So many people struggle with where to get started with AWS and cloud technologies in general. There is popular ""[How do I learn to be a Linux admin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/)"" post that inspired me to write an equivalent for cloud technologies. This post serves as a guide of goals to grow from basic AWS knowledge to understanding and deploying complex architectures in an automated way. Feel free to pick up where you feel relevant based on prior experience.

Assumptions:

- You have basic-to-moderate Linux systems administration skills
- You are at least familiar with programming/scripting. You don't need to be a whiz but you should have some decent hands-on experience automating and programming.
- You are willing to dedicate the time to overcome complex issues.
- You have an [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) and a marginal amount of money to spend improving your skills.

How to use this guide:

- This is not a step by step how-to guide.
- You should take each goal and ""figure it out"". I have hints to guide you in the right direction.
- Google is your friend. [AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) is your friend. Stack Overflow is your friend.
- Find out and implement the ""right way"", not the quick way. Ok, maybe do the quick way first then refactor to the right way before moving on.
- Shut down or de-provision as much as you can between learning sessions. You should be able to do everything in this guide for literally less than $50 using the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). Rebuilding often will reinforce concepts anyway.
- Skip ahead and read the *Cost Analysis* and *Automation* sections and have them in the back of your mind as you work through the goals.
- Lastly, just get hands on, no better time to start then NOW.

**Project Overview**

This is NOT a guide on how to develop websites on AWS. This uses a website as an excuse to use all the technologies AWS puts at your fingertips. The concepts you will learn going through these exercises apply all over AWS.

This guide takes you through a maturity process from the most basic webpage to an extremely cheap scalable web application. The small app you will build does not matter. It can do anything you want, just keep it simple.

Need an idea? Here: Fortune-of-the-Day - Display a random fortune each page load, have a box at the bottom and a submit button to add a new fortune to the random fortune list.

**Account Basics**

- Create an IAM user for your personal use.
- Set up MFA for your root user, turn off all root user API keys.
- Set up Billing Alerts for anything over a few dollars.
- Configure the AWS CLI for your user using API credentials.
- *Checkpoint: You can use the AWS CLI to interrogate information about your AWS account.*

**Web Hosting Basics**

- Deploy a EC2 VM and host a simple static ""Fortune-of-the-Day Coming Soon"" web page.
- Take a snapshot of your VM, delete the VM, and deploy a new one from the snapshot. Basically disk backup + disk restore.
- *Checkpoint: You can view a simple HTML page served from your EC2 instance.*

**Auto Scaling**

- Create an AMI from that VM and put it in an autoscaling group so one VM always exists.
- Put a Elastic Load Balancer infront of that VM and load balance between two Availability Zones (one EC2 in each AZ).
- *Checkpoint: You can view a simple HTML page served from both of your EC2 instances. You can turn one off and your website is still accessible.*

**External Data**

- Create a DynamoDB table and experiment with loading and retrieving data manually, then do the same via a script on your local machine.
- Refactor your static page into your Fortune-of-the-Day website (Node, PHP, Python, whatever) which reads/updates a list of fortunes in the AWS DynamoDB table. (Hint: EC2 Instance Role)
- *Checkpoint: Your HA/AutoScaled website can now load/save data to a database between users and sessions*

**Web Hosting Platform-as-a-Service**

- Retire that simple website and re-deploy it on Elastic Beanstalk.
- Create a S3 Static Website Bucket, upload some sample static pages/files/images. Add those assets to your Elastic Beanstalk website.
- Register a domain (or re-use and existing one). Set Route53 as the Nameservers and use Route53 for DNS. Make www.yourdomain.com go to your Elastic Beanstalk. Make static.yourdomain.com serve data from the S3 bucket.
- Enable SSL for your Static S3 Website. This isn't exactly trivial. (Hint: CloudFront + ACM)
- Enable SSL for your Elastic Beanstalk Website.
- *Checkpoint: Your HA/AutoScaled website now serves all data over HTTPS. The same as before, except you don't have to manage the servers, web server software, website deployment, or the load balancer.*

**Microservices**

- Refactor your EB website into ONLY providing an API. It should only have a POST/GET to update/retrieve that specific data from DynamoDB. Bonus: Make it a simple REST API. Get rid of www.yourdomain.com and serve this EB as api.yourdomain.com
- Move most of the UI piece of your EB website into your Static S3 Website and use Javascript/whatever to retrieve the data from your api.yourdomain.com URL on page load. Send data to the EB URL to have it update the DynamoDB. Get rid of static.yourdomain.com and change your S3 bucket to serve from www.yourdomain.com.
- *Checkpoint: Your EB deployment is now only a structured way to retrieve data from your database. All of your UI and application logic is served from the S3 Bucket (via CloudFront). You can support many more users since you're no longer using expensive servers to serve your website's static data.*

**Serverless**

- Write a AWS Lambda function to email you a list of all of the Fortunes in the DynamoDB table every night. Implement Least Privilege security for the Lambda Role. (Hint: Lambda using Python 3, Boto3, Amazon SES, scheduled with CloudWatch)
- Refactor the above app into a Serverless app. This is where it get's a little more abstract and you'll have to do a lot of research, experimentation on your own.
  - The architecture: Static S3 Website Front-End calls API Gateway which executes a Lambda Function which reads/updates data in the DyanmoDB table.
 - Use your SSL enabled bucket as the primary domain landing page with static content.
 - Create an AWS API Gateway, use it to forward HTTP requests to an AWS Lambda function that queries the same data from DynamoDB as your EB Microservice.
 - Your S3 static content should make Javascript calls to the API Gateway and then update the page with the retrieved data.
 - Once you have the ""Get Fortune"" API Gateway + Lambda working, do the ""New Fortune"" API.
- *Checkpoint: Your API Gateway and S3 Bucket are fronted by CloudFront with SSL. You have no EC2 instances deployed. All work is done by AWS services and billed as consumed.*

**Cost Analysis**

- Explore the AWS pricing models and see how pricing is structured for the services you've used.
- Answer the following for each of the main architectures you built:
 - Roughly how much would this have costed for a month?
 - How would I scale this architecture and how would my costs change?
- Architectures
 - Basic Web Hosting: HA EC2 Instances Serving Static Web Page behind ELB
 - Microservices: Elastic Beanstalk SSL Website for only API + S3 Static Website for all static content + DynamoDB Table + Route53 + CloudFront SSL
 - Serverless: Serverless Website using API Gateway + Lambda Functions + DynamoDB + Route53 + CloudFront SSL + S3 Static Website for all static content

**Automation**

!!! This is REALLY important !!!

- These technologies are the most powerful when they're automated. You can make a Development environment in minutes and experiment and throw it away without a thought. This stuff isn't easy, but it's where the really skilled people excel.
- Automate the deployment of the architectures above. Use whatever tool you want. The popular ones are AWS CloudFormation or Teraform. Store your code in AWS CodeCommit or on GitHub. Yes, you can automate the deployment of ALL of the above with native AWS tools.
- I suggest when you get each app-related section of the done by hand you go back and automate the provisioning of the infrastructure. For example, automate the provisioning of your EC2 instance. Automate the creation of your S3 Bucket with Static Website Hosting enabled, etc. This is not easy, but it is very rewarding when you see it work.

**Continuous Delivery**

- As you become more familiar with Automating deployments you should explore and implement a Continuous Delivery pipeline.
- Develop a CI/CD pipeline to automatically update a dev deployment of your infrastructure when new code is published, and then build a workflow to update the production version if approved. Travis CI is a decent SaaS tool, Jenkins has a huge following too, if you want to stick with AWS-specific technologies you'll be looking at CodePipeline.

**Miscellaneous / Bonus**

These didn't fit in nicely anywhere but are important AWS topics you should also explore:

- IAM: You should really learn how to create complex IAM Policies. You would have had to do basic roles+policies for for the EC2 Instance Role and Lambda Execution Role, but there are many advanced features.
- Networking: Create a new VPC from scratch with multiple subnets (you'll learn a LOT of networking concepts), once that is working create another VPC and peer them together. Get a VM in each subnet to talk to eachother using only their private IP addresses.
- KMS: Go back and redo the early EC2 instance goals but enable encryption on the disk volumes. Learn how to encrypt an AMI.

**Final Thoughts**

I've been recently recruiting for Cloud Systems Engineers and Cloud Systems Administrators. We've interviewed over a dozen local people with relevant resume experience. Every single person we interviewed would probably struggle starting with the DynamoDB/AutoScaling work. I'm finding there are very few people that HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THIS STUFF. Many people are familiar with the concepts, but when pushed for details they don't have answers or admit to just peripheral knowledge. You learn SO MUCH by doing.

If you can't find an excuse or get support to do this as part of your job I would find a small but flashy/impressive personal project that you can build and show off as proof of your skills. Open source it on GitHub, make professional documentation, comment as much as is reasonable, and host a demo of the website. Add links to your LinkedIn, reference it on your resume, work it into interview answers, etc. When in a job interview you'll be able to answer all kinds of real-world questions because you've been-there-done-that with most of AWS' major services.

I'm happy to hear any feedback.

We have seen tons of slight domain misspellings over the years in spoofing campaigns and thought it was dumb that spammers hadn't tried this yet so we bought it and several other unicode character variations on famous domains to keep bad actors from using them in spoofing campaigns. But there has to be something better we can do with www.ɡooɡle.com besides just sit on it.  Maybe in some awareness campaign or something?

t51kbr,sysadmin,1646232063.0,"I posted a while back asking for strategy and advice on how to ask for a pay bump from my 62k I was currently getting. My official title with the company is IT Director, while I do not manage anyone else below me I do everything (sole IT guy) and then some.

A few days ago there was a panicked email from our receptionist about one of our auto flush urinals being stuck on even after they replaced the batteries. My boss (company owner) was cc'd and I was also included in that email. Why this duty would need me is beyond my imagining but seems to be the norm for people to think ""if it runs on electricity and we can't fix it call IT!"".

Within about 10 minutes there is the owner of the company, 8 people in the mens room trying to figure out how to stop the now flooding urinal from getting worse. I see them open the battery housing unit is and point out from the back that it's corroded and we would need to replace it. We had some big important partners coming in and I could tell the boss man was panicked as it wouldn't look good to have a flooded bathroom.

They are trying to call a plumber but everyone isn't available immediately (next day or days later). I finally laugh out loud and in what could only be described as my brain autopiloting from watching McGuyver episodes back in the day I whip out a stick of gum, rip a piece and lay it between the corroded contacts and screw it back together, place the cover on and tada! It shut the valve off and starts working.

Silence, absolute silence with 8 people standing in a bathroom, my boss looks at his partner they nod and say ""follow us please"". They immediately give me a raise to 80k, offer me more vacation time acknowledge all the good I have been doing and offer me 10k raises per year till I hit 120k.

So yeah... that's how a bubblegum wrapper got me a raise :)

Update/Edit: Just wanted to add I get that some people may not believe me and that's totally understandable just don't be total jerks about it. Your opinion is cool, the rudeness isn't. I thought about posting a screenshot of my next check that has the raise amount next to my previous one (showing proof of the paybump) but figure some people are still going to call bs.

hvv11p,sysadmin,1595429090.0,"I’ve worked with one guy for ~5 years.   He’s the first to log on in the morning, always leaves a cheery message on the team channel about weather or traffic, or the local sports.  He loves to help people and clients line up to see him.

Working from home and some other things (his family called out of town) meant he was left alone in his house for 4-6 weeks.  His communication mostly restricted to slack channels.    

Did I mention I’ve never seen him have a drink after work ever?  Also, I picked up on the odd comment over the years that he has a bad relationship with alcohol.  I can take a hint and have admired his discipline.   

Recently, over a period of 3 weeks his behavior became progressively more erratic (you know where this is going).   Unplanned PTO’s and not taking care of business.   He goes offline for several days.   I text him (because he’s ignoring everything else) that I’m bringing a care package of homemade food, soups and bread to his house whether he wants it or not.  Simultaneously he posts 1 cryptic sentence on a companywide slack channel about the local hospital not caring.  As I’m about to leave for his house, he begs me not to come because he doesn’t want to be seen in such bad shape.   We have a long talk. He was less than 100%, but he did listen some.

70atmi,sysadmin,1505491718.0,"See edits below for updates!!! Up to six edits thus far.  To include the exact nature of the DNS resolver everone is asking about.

So I work for this company that is rather medium sized. I was hired three months ago. It is just myself, and one other Helpdesk guy. When I started, my compatriot told me that The Sysadmin had recently quit after not getting a raise he felt he was due, and it was just us two now.

Now before I sing his praises too much, you need to understand that my co-worker worked with him for a year but knows next to nothing. He stated that The Sysadmin handled everything that came up short of printers. The Sysadmin never answered a ticket that was printer related even if the owners asked him to. Therefore my coworker is an idiot savant. Guy knows printers and NOTHING else. But damn he can swap a fuser in like 5 seconds. But he doesn't know where anything is, or how to access anything.

I am straight out of the Geek Squad and know nothing either. I was just thrilled to have a ""real"" IT job. I still know nothing at all. But the damn place just works. I will give you an example. When my first PC died I asked the guy if there was an image. He said he had no clue, the Sysadmin handled the PC's. 

Evidently in this company of 450 PC's The Sysadmin handled installing every one. He then tells me that when one came in, he just took it straight to the user and plugged it in. So I saunter over the users desk and simply plug it in. And to my amateur eyes magic happens. It boots gets an image (from somewhere I had no clue) and boots and all the software needed is there. I assume that the user needs their documents. Nope all there. I have since learned about roaming profiles.

We just wing everything because everything just works. I have no access to the backup, because we don't have his passwords and my coworker gets an email everyday of the local servers being booted on an Azure server I don't have access to. But everyday the email comes in and shows all 19 servers running on some cloud server. It made me nervous. But at least they are being backed up. I know it sounds horrid, but I simply have no clue how to access them. And I am kinda worried that I took too long to admit it now.

When a new user was hired, I googled how to create a new user and found out about AD. Yep, had no clue about that. So I Google how to do it and log into the DC and create his account. I just copy a person from the same department and thank the gods the printers and network shares they need just show up. This is how lost I am.

Another example is that a battery backup in the server rack started beeping. I was nervous as hell, but when I looked the front of the APC has label-maker tape on it saying the model of battery enclosed and the date it was changed. Again I had to learn nothing.

But then two days ago it finally happened. Something the autopilot couldn't fix. The firewall died. I immediately was a nervous wreck. I told the owners and they found the vendor from Accounting that sold us the old one. We call the vender and they overnight a new Netgate firewall, and it comes in and I spend the whole day trying to make it work. I am at wits end as I have no damn clue what a NAT (found that word while Googling) is, or even what the WAN should be.

I eventually go to one of the owners, and explain that I simply cant fix this. I have no idea if there are configs saved somewhere I could use, but I simply cannot fix this. I am defeated. I expected to get fired, truthfully. I know I have no clue what I am doing.

He then tells me he needs to grab something that may help. He then comes back with an envelope that The Sysadmin left. He said that he had forgotten about it. In it is a thumbdrive with a note that says the password is taped on top of the last server rack. Our server room is locked so I assume that it is a secure place to leave a password. I take the drive and then go to the last server rack with a step stool and find an index card with a freaking million character password.

I go to my computer and plug in the drive and am presented with a decrypt password. The drive is only 4 gigs, so I can't imagine anything on it is helpful. But I plug in the password and there is a single txt document. I open it and there is a link with a user name and password. I click the link and it takes me to a private Wikipedia. EVERYTHING IS IN THERE!!!!

The thing is huge. But in it is all the IP's, passwords, instructions, and everything. It has 1789 entries. Every single device has an entry. I search for Netgate and it takes me to a pfSense page. That page lists everything too. IP's, services, firewall rules all of it. 

It took me two hours but with just that page I managed to piece together a working firewall. I don't know what half of what I typed does, but damn it worked! 

I am in awe of this thing. Azure server access, every server, every freaking MAC address is annoted. There is a network diagram that list every single printer, router, access point, server, all of it with IP and MAC Address.

It even has his ramblings in it on things that he cant figure out. There was an a part of the firewall page that was him bemoaning that the DNS resolver (no clue what that is) wont work with locking down port 53. 

I just want to tell the everyone that I would buy him all the whiskey he could drink if I knew where he was now. TC, if you by any chance are reading this...I LOVE YOU!


Edit: I realize I am woefully unqualified for even my helpdesk role.  Nor will I be for the next six months (though I do know what WSUS is now...woot!), but dammit I am all this company has right now.  I might not be the helpdesk guy they need, but I am the one they deserve for even hiring me.

Edit2: Update, I sent the thread to management.  They now see that I am not overblowing how incapable I am at being a Sysadmin currently.  We are going to find a Company to bring into to help with the big stuff.  Said my job is safe, and that they would be fine with using a company until I can digest what everything does.  Told me to not worry, and thanked me for being so candid.  I am also required to backup the wiki before I leave today since they now get how important it is.  

Edit3: Welp, I got my co-worker inadvertently in ""trouble"".  Did not think about kind of throwing him under the bus when I pushed this thread higher.  Owner informed him, that he would have to do more than printer support.  Though they appreciated the great printer support.  Told him I would buy him lunch all next week.  He is unaware of this thread.  Thinks I ratted directly, which I knew did.

Edit4: Contact made via text now with old Sysadmin.  He is far younger than I thought.  I assumed he would be an old crusty fogey, but when he asked my age I asked in turn.  Dude is in his 30's.  He invited me for drinks, I mentioned again I am 19 and he said I could have a soda in a sippy cup.  We are meeting in an hour.  My first bar trip!

Edit5: Told owner I was going to meet him.  He gave me a $100 to pay for everything.  Also asked me to change a few things to help hide company identity in this thread.  He is reading every comment.

Edit6:  I keep getting asked about the DNS resolver issue, here is the instruction from the wiki.  I am going to pull from the GUI page (yes there is a command page and a GUI page in the wiki).

***DNS Resolver & Forwarder Below***

1.) Assuming that you have completed the above requirements, first you have to change your DNS on pfsense to OPENDNS. To do this, go to Systems > General Setup. Under DNS Server Settings

2.) DNS Server 1: 208.67.222.222

3.) DNS Server 2: 208.67.220.220

4.) DNS Server Override: Unchecked

5.) Disable DNS Forwarder: Checked

6.) Once you finished, click Save to save all the setting you entered

7.) Once you completed the above process, you need to disable DNS Resolver and enable DNS Forwarder.

8.) I am not sure if DNS Resolver can be configured with OpenDNS/Umbrella, I tried to configure it but no luck. With DNS Forwarder, everything worked well. At this point I really don't care.

9.) To do this, you need to go to Services > DNS Resolver > Enable: (Unchecked)

10.) After that, Go to Services > DNS Forwarder > Enable: Checked

11.) Interfaces: All

12.) Click Save

13.) Navigate to Firewall > NAT, Port Forward tab

14.) Click Add to create a new rule

15.) Fill in the following fields on the port forward rule:

        Interface: LAN

        Protocol: TCP/UDP

        Destination: Invert Match checked, LAN Address

        Destination Port Range: 53 (DNS)

        Redirect Target IP: 127.0.0.1

        Redirect Target Port: 53 (DNS)

        Description: Redirect DNS

        NAT Reflection: Disable

So, I am gonna keep this brief. I am truly and properly fucked.

I accepted a role back in September of 21 in my home state. I was living on the west coast at the time.

I moved myself, my pregnant wife, two children (one disabled) cross country for this job. It was fantastic at first, I was allowed to go 99% remote within 2 months and my boss was fantastic.

Yesterday ownership rugpulled me and sold off a bunch of the operations to a competitor. I am now working to ""close up shop"", I will be employed 2 more months, will receive a bonus month of pay for staying on during the transition, and that's it.

My daughter is due in 3 weeks. My disabled son has surgery #10 in 2 weeks. I am right, and truly fucked.

Sorry to whine, but I am floored, demoralized and terrified. RIP this sysadmin :(

EDIT: Some updates, but first I want to thank everyone that expressed sympathy, offered to put in good words, links to openings and more. Your support is really encouraging in some rough times.

That said, I went to the “town hall” The  owner held. He started with saying that this caught them all by surprise even though they had been talking to this competitor, (By almost TWO YEARS!!!). He went on to say that they tried to save as many jobs as they could. He gave out some crocodile tears and refused to answer questions. (I thought this was a town hall?)

I’ll post more updates as they come.

EDIT 2: I have already been reached out to for an interview - I am hopeful of my situation and I thank everyone again for the positivity and rallying behind me like this, it's really humbling. 

I also have reason to believe now the company is merely dangling this bonus to get me to reconfigure their network to accommodate the buying entity's equipment, and that I will be dropped the moment I complete this work. I have tripled my efforts and applied to about 16 places in the last 24 hours.

EDIT 3: I want to reiterate the kindness I have been shown is breathtaking. I have 4 interviews lined up in the first 48 hours of this disaster, and I could not be more grateful to the community.

Coming soon to public preview, we're rolling out several new classifiers for Communication Compliance to assist you in detecting various types of workplace policy violations.

This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 93251, 93253, 93254, 93255, 93256, 93257, 93258

When this will happen:

Rollout will begin in late June and is expected to be complete by mid-July.

How this will affect your organization:

The following new classifiers will soon be available in public preview for use with your Communication Compliance policies.

Leavers: The leavers classifier detects messages that explicitly express intent to leave the organization, which is an early signal that may put the organization at risk of malicious or inadvertent data exfiltration upon departure.

Corporate sabotage: The sabotage classifier detects messages that explicitly mention acts to deliberately destroy, damage, or destruct corporate assets or property.

Gifts & entertainment: The gifts and entertainment classifier detect messages that contain language around exchanging of gifts or entertainment in return for service, which may violate corporate policy.

Money laundering: The money laundering classifier detects signs of money laundering or engagement in acts design to conceal or disguise the origin or destination of proceeds. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking or financial services who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for money laundering in their organization.

Stock manipulation: The stock manipulation classifier detects signs of stock manipulation, such as recommendations to buy, sell, or hold stocks in order to manipulate the stock price. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking or financial services who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for stock manipulation in their organization.

Unauthorized disclosure: The unauthorized disclosure classifier detects sharing of information containing content that is explicitly designated as confidential or internal to certain roles or individuals in an organization.

Workplace collusion: The workplace collusion classifier detects messages referencing secretive actions such as concealing information or covering instances of a private conversation, interaction, or information. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking, healthcare, or energy who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for collusion in their organization. 

What you need to do to prepare:

Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information.

When purchasing the first license they failed to mention that when they upgraded their software they would push a new version to our clients before we could have a chance to stop it, and then almost immediately prevented us from connecting to our managed systems without first upgrading.

After we purchased these ""lifetime"" licenses, they abruptly switched to a subscription model.

The cost of that subscription has increased by about 100% in the last 4 years, and now they've implemented really low device limits!

So not only has my cost doubled, I would have to purchase additional licensing just to keep managing the same number of computers I have managed all along.

This is a slight bit off beat for this sub, but since I think we're all security-minded in some fashion or another I wanted to share a personal tale of utter frustration.

Months back, I awoke one morning to discover hundreds of dollars of digital gift cards purchased on my Amazon account. No random OTP codes were sent to my phone, email, and I did not enter in my authenticator code recently. I frantically deleted all my payment information from Amazon as I contacted their ""customer support"". Fun fact: There is no fraud department available to Amazon customers. No, not even Prime members. Their internal investigations department will ""email within 48 hours"", which does f--- all for a security breach happening in the moment.

So I immediately did what any professional IT/IS guy does: I began the lockdown. All associated devices get removed from the account. All active sessions get killed. I wipe browser cache. I do a full security scan of the system. I change my email password. I change my Amazon password. I even swapped my 2FA authenticator service. Then, out of increasing paranoia, I change the password on every associated site and service I can think of, including my banks and credit cards.

Finally Amazon emails me and agrees the charges were fraud, and tells me to get my money back I have to initiate a chargeback from my financial institutions. Well, that starts the whole ""cancel all cards and reissue"" snowball rolling down hill. Fun!

After which I seemed to have solved whatever breach happened, although their ""investigation"" would tell me absolutely zero but a canned template email with no exact information regarding how it happened... especially without a OTP code generated from the 2FA authenticator. My trust factor dipped a lot. Surprising that such a huge company has such a small and careless attitude about fraud.

Fast forward to today. I get the email, ""Your order is confirmed..."". Yup, I've been there before. Rush to the account, rip out all payment information. Luckily this time, it was only two Playstation gift cards for small change. But the inevitable, exasperated sentence screams in my head: ""How the f--- did this happen *again*?!""

I review all my movements. Did I log in anywhere unsafe? Nope. Only my iPhone (up-to-date, not jailbroken) and my Windows 10 PC through a very restricted FireFox setup (no saved pwds, containers for most big services, NoScript, tweaked config, etc.). I never opt to bypass 2FA for any device. I didn't get any emails about access, or password resets, or anything. Nothing on my phone through SMS. (Quick note: My cell account is locked down with not only the usual user/pass, but 2FA *and* a PIN code... and I've opted into enhanced security on my account to prevent hijacking fraud. So I feel comfortable that it's unlikely my SMS has been tampered with.) I've not linked my Amazon to any third parties (i.e. Twitch), and I don't have any services or subscriptions. I don't use the Amazon app store. The only other services I use are Amazon Music (on my iPhone) and Amazon Video (on my smart TV), and I've never bought anything through either service (mostly free with Prime), so I'd assume whatever authorization wall for transactions remains in place.

I contact Amazon. I get the first representative on the phone, and I try to explain through my frustration what happened, and the history I mentioned. This time was odd; she seemed to hesitate when reviewing the account, placing me on hold to ""talk to her resources"", and then mumbling about policy and what she can and can't say. Ultimately, she forwards me over to the ""Kindle technical department"" (I don't own a Kindle, mind you...) and I speak to another offshore gentleman. After another round of codes and account verification, I tell the tale again. However, this time, this guy pulls out a magic tool and tells me where the purchases were made--I could jump for joy with some actual evidence being presented--and he tells me it came from a Smart TV called a ""Samsung Huawei"". This sounds like immediate bulls--t and I ask him to work with me for a minute. I go up to the master bedroom and turn on the Samsung Smart TV I own. I access the Prime Video app (which I hadn't used in a few weeks) and verify I can get right in, indicating the device was still authorized and logged into my account. I have him de-authorize the culprit device and delete it. I reboot my TV. I get right into Amazon Video.

It wasn't my TV. In fact, I've never owned an Android device, or anything made by Huawei.

Of course I already suspected this, but the proof was plain to see. Now we're digging deeper. So it appears someone managed to access my account from another smart TV device (we assume) and make purchases through it. But why then, could I not see this device on my account dashboard or anywhere in my account settings for that matter? ""Because,"" he explains, ""non-Amazon devices, such as smart TVs, Roku devices, game consoles... do not show up there. In fact, even Amazon customer support cannot see those authorized devices. We have a special tool in this department to use to see all non-Amazon devices attached to your account.""

I was baffled. How many people have rogue devices fraudulently attached to their account without their knowledge, waiting to be exploited? How did they get there in the first place? Old exploit? Unknown backdoor in a smart device app? Who's to say? **And if they were added before OTP enhanced security made it's way to that particular platform, they can circumvent all 2FA requirements perpetually until removed and re-added.** That alone is a serious security problem at Amazon. All devices should have been de-authorized until a OTP was entered... but, as is too often seen in this business, I bet someone said ""Eh, they'll do it eventually."" because it was Friday and they wanted to go home. What's worse is, you'll never know, and Amazon Customer Support will never know, until you get the winning lottery transfer over to the Kindle tech who can actually see the gaping security hole with a magic tool.

Hopefully this is the end of my hair-pulling with this Amazon account. I also hope this tale helps out someone else who has done everything right from a security standpoint, and yet seems to be dealing with Amazon fraud in spite of it.

No system is absolutely secure, and no security is impenetrable. We all here know that. But I think a lot of businesses could really use some common sense full regression testing of their fraud and account security processes and liability, because things like this are just unacceptable.

Thanks for letting me rant!

**Edit:** I'm glad this has been gaining interest, sorry for the length but I felt it was beneficial to truly paint the proper picture. For those who suggested that the account should be abandoned and a new one created, I agree that is certainly the best move for security purposes. But now my inner-sleuth has come out. Logic would assume that, now that all devices have been deactivated and no longer have the authority to access or purchase on my account... if another incident occurs, can we then suggest there is a greater possibility that a loophole exploit is still uncaught on one of these ""non-Amazon"" device apps' code? This would be an even greater security concern than what it seems we have on our hands already. So now I almost want to keep the account just to leave the bait in the water and see what tugs.

I also agree that the oversight of accountability on ""non-Amazon"" devices for the Amazon customer base (specifically, the lack of visibility of these devices and management controls to remove them) needs to be addressed as a priority. One person complaining to customer service or on the Amazon twitter account does nothing. Please feel free to share, upvote, comment, and discuss this so that perhaps word of mouth creates enough buzz that it becomes worthy for Amazon to investigate. I'm more concerned on behalf of the average person who doesn't have the technical skills to identify this problem and be routed by first-level customer service telling them there is no unexpected devices on the account, just to be routinely hit with fraudulent activity.

**Edit 10/31:** This email just in..... (spoiler alert: not helpful in the least)

    Your Amazon password was disabled to protect your account. Please contact Customer Service to unlock your account.
     
    Hello,
     
    We believe that an unauthorized party may have re-accessed your account. To protect your information, we have:
     
    -- Disabled the password to your account. You can no longer use the same password for your account.
    -- Reversed any modifications made by this party.
    -- Canceled any pending orders.
    -- If appropriate, refunded purchases to your payment instrument. However, we recommend you to review all recent activity on your payment methods and report any unauthorized charges to your financial institution.
    -- Restored any gift card balance that may have been used. It may take 2 to 3 days for the gift card balance to be restored.

So, basically, an entire 24 hours later Amazon will finally do something. Meanwhile, if you didn't do these things proactively yourself, the attacker has been having a holiday with your account and payment information?

    Please allow 2 hours for these actions to take effect. After 2 hours, call Customer Service using one of the numbers below to regain access to your account.
    
    In the meantime, we recommend that you also change your email provider's password and passwords for other websites to help protect your account from being compromised again.   

Translation: ""If anyone also hacked your email, they now know how much time they have left until the mitigation takes effect. Oh wait, that makes sense. Hey, go change your email password!"" >\_\_>

**Update 11/2/2019:** Amazon still has yet to refund the $20 in fraudulent charges. Apparently I'll be told to initiate yet another fraud request to my credit card and have yet another cancelled card because Amazon can't simply refund charges properly, thus causing me undue amounts of unnecessary interruption with my credit card lender instead. Terrible practices on the accounting side over there.

*However, a spot of good news:* I have been contacted by some of the internal teams at Amazon (I have verified they are indeed who they say they are) who wanted me to know they did see this post, and are working on their end at the corporate level to investigate. This is excellent to hear! Given the sensitive nature of the problem, I do not think I will be given any details to share, nor would I want to publicize anything for attackers to leverage.... but the mere fact they have chosen to reach out and involve me directly shows they are active and taking this matter seriously.

rld45k,sysadmin,1640087682.0,"An IT contractor ordered a custom software suite from my employer for one of their customers some years ago. This contractor client was a small, couple of people operation with an older guy who introduces himself as a consultant and two younger guys. The older guy, who also runs the company is a 'likable type' but has very limited know how when it comes to IT. He loves to drop stuff like '20 years of experience on ...' but for he hasn't really done anything, just had others do stuff for him. He thinks he's managing his employees, but the smart people he has employed have just kinda worked around him, played him to get the job done and left him thinking he once again solved a difficult situation.

His company has an insane employee turnover. Like I said, he's easy to get along with, but at the same time his completele lack of technical understanding and attemps to tell professionals to what to do burns out his employees quickly. In the past couple of years he's been having trouble getting new staff, he usually has some kind of a trainee in tow until even they grow tired of his ineptitude when making technical decisions. 

My employer charges this guy a monthly fee, for which the virtual machines running the software we developed is maintained and minor tweaks to the system are done. He just fired us and informed us he will be needing some help to learn the day to day maintenance, that he's apparently going to do for himself for his customer.

I pulled the short straw and despite him telling he has 'over a decade of Linux administration', it apparently meant he installed ubuntu once. he has absolutely no concept of anything command line and he insists he'll be just told what commands to run. 

He has a list like 'ls = list files, cd = go to directory' and he thinks he's ready to take over a production system of multiple virtual machines. 

I'm both, terrified but glad he fired us so we're off the hook with the maintenance contract. I'd almost want to put a bag of popcorn in the microwave oven, but I'm afraid I'll be the one trying to clean up with hourly billable rate once he does his first major 'oops'.

7vqg29,sysadmin,1517949922.0,"When you get hired, come in and criticize all the old long running systems as old, running on outdated languages like java, you force your company to use cloud functions, machine learning, consolidating data ponds to data lakes and other tech to ""keep up with the times"". Never get locked into maintaining old systems. You won't get any credit and it's a huge mental burden to actually learn how large, complex distributed systems, written by many different people over years and years, actually work. It's better you look for the most expensive vendors that do similar things as inhouse legacy systems, because IT is not the core business, and hook your company into huge license fees, and get a back room cut of the commission.

Then, the most important thing to do is hire from bangalore. Slowly replace people across the org starting with the oldest most knowledgeable people with teams of cheap poor performing India ""blends"" of many junior developers a senior developer. The trick is to very quickly promote 25% of the juniors at lower than the cost of a real mid level, just not all at the same time. This also motivates the India team for the next round of ""sporadic"" promotions, and it also convinces upper management that the India teams are at the same skill level. Senior local IT will have been rewarded for long time loyalty, and creating the legacy systems you're replacing. They will often be hostile to your changes, be upset you're replacing their systems, be angry at your lack of institutional knowledge not stopping you from making these sales transition pitches to the c-suite. Getting rid of vocal senior staff with large bangalore teams is important early on or you may not get further.

Start saying the company is in cost cutting phase, and benefits and perks will be reduced 20% year over year. Since you're getting rid of senior staff first, in the early phase you'll be saving a lot of money, but it's good to place going concern with your staff that they can easily be replaced and their environment is not stable. This makes them more concerned about job security and standing out. This will lead to the appearance of revenue in the next quarter, as senior staff is eliminated, and you can pocket a sizable chunk of it as your bonus, and this provides social proof to the c-suite your methods simply work.

Put on your resume you increased revenue in your company year over year by XX million dollars, mostly from layoffs of leadership, but it's better to attribute your changes. With this you can now jump as an SVP to another firm. This is the critical point. Do heavy networking across the org, give speeches about the cloud technologies, containers, machine learning, that's earning companies billions. By positioning yourself as a thought leader in disruptive technologies and name dropping big company names and the millions they earned across different case studies, you puppeteer the association between high value and what you offer. Continue this strategy until top performers start dropping off the map, unable to cope with working with, and keep fixing the work the poor performing India teams keeps creating. At this point, you have to short the stock of the company through a spouse or relative, divest your assets and keep a minimal of your stock options. Once the company is full of technical debt, blame an increasingly competing competitive landscape, and ""lead"" the company though these hard times. At this point you should be actively trying to find another SVP or exec role at another firm. 

It's almost a joke how easy it is to pull this off.

>*On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from 700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a sample of the data that includes 1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:*

* *Full names*
* *Phone numbers*
* *Physical addresses*
* *Geolocation records*
* *LinkedIn username and profile URL*
* *Personal and professional experience/background*

*We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.*

No passwords are included, but as the site notes, this is still valuable data that can be used for identity theft and convincing-looking phishing attempts that can themselves be used to obtain login credentials for LinkedIn and other sites.

With the previous breach, LinkedIn did confirm that the 500M records included data obtained from its servers, but claimed that more than one source was used. The company had not responded to a request for comment on this one at the time of writing.

11hk5ss,sysadmin,1677889791.0,"Sorry, this is a bit of a rant.

Some how our C level management got the idea that they wanted to be a company that bases themselves on higher education employees. Our IT manager at the time hired the best fit for the job before this but was strong armed into preferring college graduates. The manager was forced out because he pushed back too much, so they hired a new manager named Simon about six months ago. Simon was a used car salesman until about 8 years ago then he got an IT management degree from a for-profit college. Since then he has spent about a year or two at each job, “cleaning them up” then moving on. He has no technical ambition and thinks a lot of it is stuff you can just pick up.

On his second day, Simon pulled all of the system and network admins into a meeting (about of us 12 total) and told us his vision and what the C levels expected of him. Higher education is a must and will be the basis on how everything is measured from this point forward. That all certifications and qualifications will be deleted from the employee records as these were just “tests that can be aced if you know how to read a book”. Also he will be dividing the teams up into a Scrum type of setup moving forward. We also started to get almost-daily emails from Simon on higher education, what I would consider graduate propaganda. Things like statistics, income differences, etc., types of things colleges send to companies to recruit potential students.

As you guessed it, there was the “gold” team which was all of the team members with degrees (5 people) and the “yellow” team with people who were without (7 people). Most of the gold team was newer to the company and still learning the infrastructure so the knowledge in the teams was a bit lopsided. Although Simon tried to enforce subtle segregation, the teams still worked with each other like before and a few things changed, mainly how different tickets were routed. The gold team seemed to get the higher level tickets, projects, and tasks, while the yellow team workflow was becoming more like a help desk for issues. Simon also rewrote the job titles and requirements for our department. You guessed it, sys/network admins need a four year degree, junior sys/network admins need a two year degree, no experience required for each position although a customer service background was preferred.

Within a couple of weeks of the formation of the teams, Simon was only including the gold team on the higher level meetings and gatherings and kind of ignoring the yellow team. These included infrastructure projects, weekly huddles, and even new employee interviews. The gold team was still learning the ropes when we were segregated so after a lot of these meetings, they would come back to the yellow team to go over the information or get advice. Simon didn’t like this and tried a few measures to keep them from talking to us in the yellow team but I won’t get into that here. Simon also refused to talk to anyone in the yellow team about this time. If we wanted to talk to Simon, it was ""highly suggested"" we go through the gold team or HR.

Members of the yellow team saw the writing on the wall and started to filter out of the company to other jobs. The replacements were always fresh college grads with no experience. Simon was convinced that the actual IT level of operations at our company was so simple a monkey could do it so anyone with a degree could be trained in the day-to-day operations without issue. Things started to have issues, fail, or otherwise prevent work from being done by the company as a whole. As an example, Azure AD had issues connecting to the local DC/AD server and instead asking anyone on the yellow team for help (we still had 2 O365 experts), Simon brought in an expensive consultant to resolve the issue. He wasn’t above spending money to prove that non-college degree employees weren’t needed.

About a month ago there was three of us left in the yellow team and at this point there was a stigma within the IT division about us from Simon’s constant babbling. One of the outbound yellow team members went to a labor attorney about the whole thing and there was nothing that could be done within reason. By this point we lost our admin level credentials and sat in the same section as the help desk, being their escalation point for the most part. Simon also thought physical work was below his team so he either outsourced or had the help desk do any rack, wiring closet, or cable running work. The sys/network admins used to be the only ones allowed into the datacenter or the wiring closets but now anyone in IT could go in them per Simon.

So last week it happened, we got a registered letter (one that you signed for) sent to us at our office! It was a legalese letter stating we have 45 days to show proof of a college degree or we will be terminated. The requirements of the job duties have changed and our “contributions” to the company show that we can no longer fulfill the minimal level needed to be considered productive. It went on with a few in subtle insults we all heard from Simon and his daily emails. Luckily the remaining yellow team members including myself have jobs lined up. However I feel for the end users in this company.

I created this account to post this last week but was met with the posting waiting period then got tied up with real life and just got back to posting this now. Simon is a fake name but I know he and the gold team are on here trying to figure out how to do their jobs since there is an experience vacuum coming up (i.e. The newest network admin didn't know what an ICMP packet was). Some of the information is summarized or condensed to get the whole story shorter.

&#x200B;

As suggested, an edit:

1. I have a job lined up, I will be starting at that company before the 45 days is up.
2. We had a lawyer look at the process we went through. There is nothing we can do that won't cost more money that we would see in a settlement. Right to work state, changing job requirements we can't meet, and ""compliance warning"" letters are key factors here.
3. We all signed NDA agreements so I can't say who this is nor any names for one year after I leave the company. I can say it is in the medical industry but that's it.
4. The ""C"" team pushed for the higher education/customer service movement. Simon is just the perfect person to do that and they knew it. I'm thinking a college gave them some type of kickback or incentives for it that were hard to pass up. Degrees are an increasing thing in our area so they are probably just trying to stay ahead of the curve.
5. Add to point 4., they are focusing on hiring retail workers (\*customer service focused) for the help desk now. Since we got shoved into the help desk pen, this has been half of our job, hand holding and cleaning up messes they make. Simon kept repeating on how this is how the industry evolving, you can teach tech to anyone but you can't teach customer service skills and a good personality. The last guy they just hired hasn't touched a computer since high school 5 years ago and was a cashier at a box store.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/11hk5ss/we_were_given_45_days_to_prove_we_have_a_college/,"We were given 45 days to prove we have a college degree, or be terminated.

9mk2o7,sysadmin,1539041920.0,"This is probably the most bizarre issue I've had in my career in IT. One of our multi-practice facilities is having a new MRI installed and apparently something went wrong when testing the new machine. We received a call near the end of the day from the campus stating that none of their cell phones worked after testing the new MRI. My immediate thought was that the MRI must have emitted some sort of EMP, in which case we could be in a lot of trouble. We're still waiting to hear back from GE as to what happened. This facility is our DR site so my boss and the CTO were freaking out and sent one of us out there to make sure the data center was fully operational. After going out there we discovered that this issue only impacted iOS devices. iPads, iPhones, and Apple Watches were all completely disabled (or destroyed?). Every one of our assets was completely fine. It doesn't surprise me that a massive, powerful, super-conducting electromagnet is capable of doing this. What surprises me is that it is only effecting Apple products. Right now we have about 40 users impacted by this, all of which will be getting shiny new devices tonight. GE claims that the helium is what impacts the iOS devices which makes absolutely no sense to me. I know liquid helium is used as a coolant for the super-conducting magnets, but why would it only effect Apple devices? ~~I'm going to xpost to~~ r/askscience\~\~, but I thought it might spark some interest on here as well.\~\~ Mods of r/askscience and r/science approved my post.

UPDATE:

I will create another post once I have more concrete information as I'm sure not everybody will see this.

Today was primarily damage control. We spent some time sitting down with users and getting information from their devices as almost all of them need to be replaced. I did find out a few things while I was there.

I can confirm that this ONLY disabled iphones and apple watches. There were several android users in the building while this occurred and none of them experienced any long term (maybe even short term) issues. Initially I thought this only impacted users on one side of the building, but from what I've heard today it seems to be multiple floors across the facility.

The behavior of the devices was pretty odd. Most of them were completely dead. I plugged them in to the wall and had no indication that the device was charging. I'd like to plug a meter in and see if it's drawing any power, but I'm not going to do this. The other devices that were powering on seemed to have issues with the cellular radio. The wifi connection was consistent and fast, but cellular was very hit or miss. One of the devices would just completely disconnect from cellular like the radio was turned off, then it would have full bars for a moment before losing connectivity again. The wifi radio did not appear to have any issues. Unfortunately I don't have access to any of the phones since they are all personal devices. I really can only sit down with it for a few minutes and then give it back to the end user.

We're  being told that the issue was caused by the helium and how it interacts with the microelectronics. u/captaincool and u/luckyluke193 brought up some great points about helium's interaction with MEMS devices, but it seems unlikely that there would have been enough helium in the atmosphere to create any significant effects on these devices. We won't discount this as a possibility though. The tech's noted that they keep their phones in plastic ziplock bags while working on the machines. I don't know how effective they would be if it takes a minuscule amount of He to destroy the device, and helium being as small as it is could probably seep a little bit in to a plastic bag.

We're going to continue to gather information on this. If I find out anything useful I will update it here. Once this case is closed I'll create a follow-up as a new post on this sub. I don't know how long it will take. I'll post updates here in the meantime unless I'm instructed to do otherwise.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I discovered that the helium leakage occurred while the new magnet was being ramped. Approximately 120 liters of liquid He were vented over the course of 5 hours. There was a vent in place that was functioning, but there must have been a leak. The MRI room is not on an isolated HVAC loop, so it shares air with most or all of the facility. We do not know how much of the 120 liters ended up going outdoors and how much ended up inside. Helium expands about 750 times when it expands from a liquid to a gas, so that's a lot of helium (90,000 m^(3)  of gaseous He).

Our company made the decision to return to office in a hybrid mode, in office minimum of 2 days a week.  After they made the announcement with the date, then they started planning.  Questions abound, no answers and no forethought to the different situations many people have to deal with before returning to office.  When we all went remote, staff were allowed to bring monitors, keyboard/mouse, and docking stations home.  To make the hybrid 'experience' more seamless, it was decided that all the desks would be re-equipped with docks, monitors and mouse/keyboard combos.  So we did inventory, came up with a dollar amount and submitted it.  The answer?  ""We have not authorized any funds for this.  You just need to make this work.""

I’ve been a pilot for Southwest Airlines for over 35 years. I’ve given my heart and soul to Southwest Airlines during those years. And quite honestly Southwest Airlines has given its heart and soul to me and my family. 

Many of you have asked what caused this epic meltdown. Unfortunately, the frontline employees have been watching this meltdown coming like a slow motion train wreck for sometime. And we’ve been begging our leadership to make much needed changes in order to avoid it. What happened yesterday started two decades ago. 

Herb Kelleher was the brilliant CEO of SWA until 2004. He was a very operationally oriented leader. Herb spent lots of time on the front line. He always had his pulse on the day to day operation and the people who ran it. That philosophy flowed down through the ranks of leadership to the front line managers. We were a tight operation from top to bottom. We had tools, leadership and employee buy in. Everything that was needed to run a first class operation. When Herb retired in 2004 Gary Kelly became the new CEO. 

Gary was an accountant by education and his style leading Southwest Airlines became more focused on finances and less on operations. He did not spend much time on the front lines. He didn’t engage front line employees much. When the CEO doesn’t get out in the trenches the neither do the lower levels of leadership. 

Gary named another accountant to be Chief Operating Officer (the person responsible for day to day operations). The new COO had little or no operational background. This trickled down through the lower levels of leadership, as well. 

They all disengaged the operation, disengaged the employees and focused more on Return on Investment, stock buybacks and Wall Street. This approach worked for Gary’s first 8 years because we were still riding the strong wave that Herb had built. 

But as time went on the operation began to deteriorate. There was little investment in upgrading technology (after all, how do you measure the return on investing in infrastructure?) or the tools we needed to operate efficiently and consistently. As the frontline employees began to see the deterioration in our operation we began to warn our leadership. We educated them, we informed them and we made suggestions to them. But to no avail. The focus was on finances not operations. As we saw more and more deterioration in our operation our asks turned to pleas. Our pleas turned to dire warnings. But they went unheeded. After all, the stock price was up so what could be wrong? 

We were a motivated, willing and proud employee group wanting to serve our customers and uphold the tradition of our beloved airline, the airline we built and the airline that the traveling public grew to cheer for and luv. But we were watching in frustration and disbelief as our once amazing airline was becoming a house of cards. 

A half dozen small scale meltdowns occurred during the mid to late 2010’s. With each mini meltdown Leadership continued to ignore the pleas and warnings of the employees in the trenches. We were still operating with 1990’s technology. We didn’t have the tools we needed on the line to operate the sophisticated and large airline we had become. We could see that the wheels were about ready to fall off the bus. But no one in leadership would heed our pleas. 

When COVID happened SWA scaled back considerably (as did all of the airlines) for about two years. This helped conceal the serious problems in technology, infrastructure and staffing that were occurring and being ignored. But as we ramped back up the lack of attention to the operation was waiting to show its ugly head. 

Gary Kelly retired as CEO in early 2022. Bob Jordan was named CEO. He was a more operationally oriented leader. He replaced our Chief Operating Officer with a very smart man and they announced their priority would be to upgrade our airline’s technology and provide the frontline employees the operational tools we needed to care for our customers and employees. Finally, someone acknowledged the elephant in the room. 

But two decades of neglect takes several years to overcome. And, unfortunately to our horror, our house of cards came tumbling down this week as a routine winter storm broke our 1990’s operating system. 

The frontline employees were ready and on station. We were properly staffed. We were at the airports. Hell, we were ON the airplanes. But our antiquated software systems failed coupled with a decades old system of having to manage 20,000 frontline employees by phone calls. No automation had been developed to run this sophisticated machine. 

We had a routine winter storm across the Midwest last Thursday. A larger than normal number flights were cancelled as a result. But what should have been one minor inconvenient day of travel turned into this nightmare. After all, American, United, Delta and the other airlines operated with only minor flight disruptions. 

The two decades of neglect by SWA leadership caused the airline to lose track of all its crews. ALL of us. We were there. With our customers. At the jet. Ready to go. But there was no way to assign us. To confirm us. To release us to fly the flight. And we watched as our customers got stranded without their luggage missing their Christmas holiday. 

I believe that our new CEO Bob Jordan inherited a MESS. This meltdown was not his failure but the failure of those before him. I believe he has the right priorities. But it will take time to right this ship. A few years at a minimum. Old leaders need to be replaced. Operationally oriented managers need to be brought in. I hope and pray Bob can execute on his promises to fix our once proud airline. Time will tell. 

It’s been a punch in the gut for us frontline employees. We care for the traveling public. We have spent our entire careers serving you. Safely. Efficiently. With luv and pride. We are horrified. We are sorry. We are sorry for the chaos, inconvenience and frustration our airline caused you. We are angry. We are embarrassed. We are sad. Like you, the traveling public, we have been let down by our own leaders. 

Herb once said the the biggest threat to Southwest Airlines will come from within. Not from other airlines. What a visionary he was. I miss Herb now more than ever.""

1 hour later they said their brute force detection platform had flagged our IP and took down our VPN tunnel.

Software rollouts aren’t usually fun, especially when they’re hastily patching a production bug.

A few lifetimes ago, my team had to move the company’s internal software to a larger server overnight without the assistance of the development team. And for bonus points, the dev team lead had a habit of not showing up during big releases and turning off his phone.

The plan was simple:  
\- Migrate to a bigger server  
\- Send users to the bigger server  
\- ???  
\- All problems are solved

Users were notified of the details via email, and signs were posted on the doors as they entered the office. Restart your computer, and the automated scripts will update the links to point to the new server.

This plan didn’t account for   
\- User-created bookmarks to specific pages on the application  
\- User preference to use browsers that weren’t Internet Explorer  
\- Users not reading posted signs, emails or restarting their computers  
\- The current web server was already sized properly, and the issues were actually being caused by shitty code and database queries causing deadlocks, which more RAM or processing power on the web server wasn't going to fix.

Rather than field 100+ different user tickets and helpdesk calls throughout the day, I did something to make a big enough splash that everyone would hear about it first thing in the morning. I set the older server to respond to all web requests with a page with the infamous [cat playing the piano video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ).

So when a user reported an issue, we’d ask:  
\- Do you see a cat? You’re on the old server. Restart your computer, use the bookmark that updated automatically, and delete all other bookmarks.  
\- Is the cat playing the piano? You’re using Chrome. Use Internet Explorer instead (this was cringy even in 2011, but the shitty app only worked on IE).  
\- Can you hear the sound? You’re using Firefox. Use Internet Explorer instead.

&#x200B;

It brought some levity to an otherwise stressful day, and all was well in the world. Of course, the dev team lead was livid, but every other interaction we had with the users was positive.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just realized it isn't clear: the users that restarted their computers were sent to the new server without any issues. The only ones that saw the cat video were the ones that didn't restart or had bookmarks to certain unauthenticated/poorly thought-out sections of the site.

hwehs7,sysadmin,1595506045.0,"I'm dealing with an issue with a piece of s... oftware at the moment that has been more or less a disaster since we implemented it. The developers, probably because they think it is fun or quirky, have decided to add ""cute"" status messages that pop up on the screen while the application loads. Things like ""This shouldn't take long"", ""Turning on and off"", ""Fighting Dragons"", ""Doing magic"". You can imagine. These guys have great futures as writers for the Borderlands games probably.

Thing is, if the process this application is waiting for never actually responds and there is no timeout mechanic, then you suddenly have a lot of users not in on the joke who have no idea that this is a loading screen that has timed out. These users will then ask a bunch of even more confusing than usual questions to their support staff. 

Furthermore you have a pissed off a sysadmin that has to stare at a rotating array of increasingly terrible jokes over and over while he is trying to verify if the application works or not. And this might lead to said sysadmin making certain observations about the hubris of a programmer who is so confident in their ability to make something that never fails that they think status messages are a platform for their failed comedy career rather than providing information about what the application is trying to do or why it is not succeeding at it.

But then again, what to expect when even Microsoft has devolved into the era of ""Fixing some stuff""- type of status messages. If I ever go on a murder rampage, check my computer, because there is a 100% chance that the screen will display a spinning loading icon and a rotating array of nonsense status messages, which is what inevitably pushed me over the edge.

I work in a large company, over 14K employees. I have been here in IT and cybersec for over 15 years managing a nice team of people who worked hard and made genuine improvements over the years. I am the go-to staffer when people need stuff done or have a problem.

My old boss retired last year, I had a huge amount of respect for them, they were old school and you knew where you stood with them - clear instruction, they had my back and they had a vision which was clearly communicated to me so I could push our team in the right direction.

My new boss is lovely, but a pure scattergun, clear lack of direction on anything, latest and greatest is the focus for now, there's been a few red flags which were ignored despite me pointing them out, in short - not great. A wonderful person, but just not a great boss.

Example: A few of our department post funding were coming to an end, I'd prepared a paper to help justify these back in May last year, new boss liked it but didn't sign it off until October due to me continually reminding them that it needed to be done, due to delays I lost two superb staff, then a third. These were staff I'd mentored for around 5 years, who worked well as a team, I was gutted to lose them.  My boss saw this as ""a new start and opportunity"" so now the funding I applied for has been secured the first conversation I have with my boss I'm told that ""it's been decided"" to allocate 2 of the 3 posts elsewhere in the department, basically screwing me over. My boss is the only person who could have made that decision.

This pissed me off and in December I applied for a job I have no earthly reason to get, auditor, regulation, huge pay rise, work from home.

Today after the third interview I got a call to say they'd like to hire me, I had to pick myself up off the floor. I'm an older guy, I have no degree, I have some professional qualifications but that's it, this shit does not happen to me. They said due to my experience, technical knowledge and comms skills they wanted to over me near the top of the banding. Essentially I just tripled my take home pay.

On Monday I will be informing my boss. I'm not sure how to approach it but I'll have a think over the weekend. I will be thanking my boss as I would never have thought of leaving a place I loved and people I liked until they came along. One thing that sticks in my mind though was our conversation where I was told I was losing 2 of the 3 posts after already losing staff I had mentored for years.

s2z7y8,sysadmin,1642079792.0,"Morning,

I found a Raspberry Pi on my network yesterday. It was plugged in behind a printer stand in an area that's accessible to the public. There's no branding on it and I can't get in with default credentials.

I'm going to plug it into an air gapped dumb switch and scan it for version and ports to see what it was doing. Besides that, what would you all do to see what it was for?

Update: I setup Lansweeper Monday, saw the Pi, found and disabled the switchport Monday afternoon and hunted down the poorly marked wall jack yesterday. I've been with this company for a few months as their IT Manager, I know I should have setup Lansweeper sooner. There were a couple things keeping me from doing this earlier.

The Pi was covered in HEAVY dust so I think it's been here awhile. There was an audit done in the 2nd quarter of last year and I'm thinking/hoping they left this behind and just didn't want to put it in the closet...probably not right? The Pi also had a DHCP address.

I won't have an update until at least the weekend. I'm in the middle of a server migration. This is also why I haven't replied to your comments...and because there's over 600 of them 👍",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/s2z7y8/found_a_raspberry_pi_on_my_network/,Found a Raspberry Pi on my network.,,2893,823,0.97

Additions are welcome.

# [The Tenets of IT](https://github.com/DavidBrightSparc/Tenets-of-IT)

1. Reboot, reinstall, replace.
2. Rebooting is a band aid. Figure out why you had to.
3. It's always DNS.
4. When it’s not DNS, it’s MTU.
5. When it’s not MTU, it’s BGP.
6. When it’s not BGP, it’s LACP.
7. Under-promise, over-deliver.
8. Plan for the worst, hope for the best.
9. Always implement two-factor-authentication, no matter how loudly the users complain.
10. Have the user show you the problem, often it is the user doing something in an unusual way.
11. Fast. Cheap. Good. You may pick one, two if you're lucky.
12. Never stop learning.
13. The Six Ps: Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.
14. It's always an emergency, until it incurs an extra charge.
15. Everyone has a test environment, not everyone is lucky enough to have a separate production environment.
16. If anyone can't find the documentation it's not documented, if it's not documented it doesn't exist.
17. If you think it's going to be a disaster, get it in writing and CYA.
18. Poor planning on a users part, does not constitute an emergency on yours.
19. Fridays are read-only. (aka - no changes on a Friday)
20. A backup isn't a backup until you've restored successfully from it.
21. Snapshots are not backups.
22. If a backup isn't off-site, it isn't a backup.
23. If it isn't in a ticket, it's not getting done.
24. Treat all users the same, regardless of their last name.
25. It's never a ""5 minute thing"".
26. Security and ease of use.. rarely walk hand in hand.
27. *""Not my circus, not my monkeys.""*
28. Everybody lies.
29. Never ask a user a question that you can easily confirm yourself.
30. The fastest path to resolution first requires removing the user from the problem. (aka isolate layer 8)
31. You are replaceable at work, no matter how highly you think of yourself. You are not replaceable at home.
32. Never give a web developer/designer access to the DNS.
33. Own up to your mistakes. That way, when it isn’t your fault, people will believe you.
34. If you have to do something twice, automate it.
35. Never spend 6 minutes doing something manually, that you spend 6 hours failing to automate.
36. To make an error is human. To propagate an error to all servers in an automatic way is devops.
37. Skilled IT professionals will continuously be given more work, until they can do none of it skilfully.
38. Give me a new hire that is a blank slate and willing to learn, over a seasoned tech that hates this job and doesn't want to learn or change.
39. IT time is relative.
40. Yes it's free/cheap. No, it's not going in the server room.
41. You provide the problem and business case, let IT provide the solution.
42. IT's job is to solve people problems with technology.
43. Technology can't solve people problems.
44. Nothing is more permanent than a temporary expedient.
45. Fix the problem now, it's just going to happen again when it's less convenient.
46. If the network guys say it's not the network, there is an 80% chance it's the network.
47. Traceroute is your friend.
48. 80% of the time CAPEX becomes OPEX when you can get 0% financing. Accounting HATES CAPEX.
49. If it doesn't log automatically make it log! Log's just spit out the answer for you!
50. There are some jobs and clients you must walk away from.
51. If you can smell the magic smoke, you’re already screwed.
52. ""Working just fine"" and ""too screwed to log an error"" look an awful lot alike.
53. The longer everything goes according to plan, the bigger the impending disaster.
54. Sales Engineers are a gift from heaven, they prevent salespeople from over-promising.
55. Printers have moods, most of the time that mood is 'Fuck you'.

>I feel like most people in the comments are not understanding the mechanism that makes this potentially problematic. I will admit that the author of the website, focusing primarily on his disdain for a particular corporation, doesn't help clarify the point.

>A **significant** amount of software automatically converts parts of text that *appear* to be URLs (even without an explicit protocol) into clickable links. These include mail clients, messengers, internet forums, social media sites, CMS systems, text editors, etc.

>Until now, such software would convert *hello.com* into a clickable link (since .com is a valid TLD) but would leave *hello.zip* as is (since .zip wasn't one). This won't change overnight, but gradually it will, as software libraries are updated with the current list of valid TLDs. This means that soon, whenever anyone mentions a zip file by name (in a message, email or a post), it will inadvertently become a link. To the reader, it will appear as if the author intentionally linked the file to assist the reader in finding it (e.g., ""Then you need to download [documents-backup.zip](https://documents-backup.zip) from our intranet portal""). So, they'll click on the link expecting to download the file.

>As an attacker, all I have to do is register the *documents-backup.zip* domain and upload a malicious zip file to the root of the domain. It will starts downloading as soon as someone opens http://documents-backup.zip. The individual clicking on the link expects a zip file to download - and it will, but it will be a malicious file from a third-party, not from the author of the message or a post.

>So as a result we get a **trusted** source inadvertently linking to a malicious file, which is very different from scenarios discussed in other comments.

nbw9vl,sysadmin,1620953356.0,"Back in October we got Crypto'd; DCs, file servers, backups all wiped.  The usual.  We didn't pay a ransom and we only lost ~4 hours worth of data due to the snapshots on our Nimble SAN, so we came out of it in possibly the best-case scenario.

Since then we got an almost blank check from Management for anything security-related, so the first half of this year have been a whirlwind of writing big checks and implementing new systems and concepts.  Many late nights deploying new configs, re-architecting networks, and deciphering marketing buzzwords to figure out which of these big shiny logos perpetually being pitched at our pocketbooks actually made sense for our environment.

It's been a lot, and while it's been exciting it's also been tiring.  I slept in my office (pulled a cot in here) for the week  recovering from the attack, and then again earlier this spring when a couple of deployments didn't go as smoothly as planned.  But it's mostly in place and we're in a much more solid position now than we were a year ago.

And usually I'd expect that would be the end of the story; I've been in this industry my whole life and I can't imagine doing anything else, but I've accepted the fact that we'll always be toiling in the shadows.  If we do our jobs properly, no one notices.  We're a cost center after all.

So imagine my surprise last month ago at our company all-hands meeting when our CEO calls each of us out specifically, by name, and thanks us in front of the entire company for them all still having jobs.  In a ~60 second speech he delivered more recognition and praise for the work we do than I ever expected I'd get in my entire career, and the weeks since have been a very odd situation of people thanking me in the hallways and seeming to have some concept of exactly what it is we do.

And to top it off, last week my boss dropped something else on my desk; an extra bonus check for $5,000 as a thank-you for the work I've put in.

Hello Sysadmins,

I need your help. In one of our network closets (which is in a room which is always locked and can't be opened without a key) we found [THIS Raspberry Pi with some USB Dongle](https://pictshare.net/zgmv70ubpu.jpg) connected to one of the switches.

## More images and closeups
- https://pictshare.net/gfss00puet.jpg
- https://pictshare.net/7c48qvg0d5.jpg
- https://pictshare.net/kkap9coh99.jpg

I made an image of the SD card and mounted it on my machine.

## Here's what I found out about the image (just by looking at the files, I did not reconnect the Pi):
- The image is a [balena.io (former resin.io) raspberry Pi image](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started/raspberry-pi/nodejs/#adding-your-first-device)
- In the config files I found the SSID and password of the wifi network it tries to connect. I have an address by looking up the SSID and BSSID on wigle.net
- It loads docker containers on boot which are updated every 10 hours
- The docker containers seem to load some balena nodejs environment but I can't find a specific script other than the app.js which is obfuscated 2Mb large
- The boot partition has a [config.json file](https://pictshare.net/y9tq3d93ru.png) where I could find out the user id, user name and a bit more. But I have no idea if I can use this to find out what scripts were loaded or what they did. But I did find a person by googling the username. Might come in handy later
- Looks like the device connects to a VPN on resin.io

## What I want to find out
1. Can I extract any information of the docker containers from the files in /var/lib/docker ? [I have the folder structure](https://pictshare.net/7mvr8upade.png) of a normal docker setup. Can I get container names or something like this from it?
2. I can't boot the Pi. I dd'd the image to a new sd card but neither first gen rasPi nor RasPi 3b can boot (nothing displayed, even with isolated networks no IP is requested, no data transmitted). Can I make a RaspPi VM somehow and load the image directly?
3. the app.js I found is 2m big and obfuscated. Any chance I can make it readable again?

I've worked here for just under a year, I'm 25 and started right after finishing school.

First week I started I had an auditor call me since an IT-audit was due. Never heard of it, had to power through.

The old IT guy left 6 months before I started. Had to train myself and get familiar with the infrastructure (bunch of old 2008 R2 servers). Started migrating our on-prem into a data center since the CEO wanted no business of having our own servers anymore.

CEO called me after-hours on my private cellphone, had to take an old employees phone and use his number so people from work could call me. They never thought about giving me a work phone.

9vfvuz,sysadmin,1541725226.0,"This week has been an incredibly difficult one for me, so I apologize now for the length as well as the stream of consciousness.

&#x200B;

I have worked at various companies over the years, and yet one thing stands as the focal point throughout my career. Every single team member that I have worked with has become akin to family, and my current position is no different. The sheer number of hours, the random ""fires"" that pop up, the fortitude and solidarity of these incredible people has never ceased to amaze me. We still keep in touch even if we no longer work together, and sometimes if the stars align, we even work together again.

&#x200B;

A little over a year ago one of the Developers, Derek, that I worked with was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon Cancer and given 6 months to live. To be honest, I didn't believe him when that inevitable phone call came. As a 38 year old, healthy male, I honestly thought that the doctors made a mistake. I remember hastily packing up my stuff and heading to the hospital where he had been admitted to see if I could get to the bottom of what was truly going on.

&#x200B;

But the doctors were correct. He had cancer and it was not only in his colon, but also his liver and bloodstream. The MRI report said his colon was ""riddled with masses"". Sitting in the room with him while he received the news was not only shocking, but heart wrenching, and yet he apologized to me for leaving the team in the lurch. That was his main concern. Not his health, not the fact that he would die, but the team and the workload.

&#x200B;

As time progressed, his health deteriorated and he was in and out of the hospital for months. I would call him during my commute to the office and the conversations we had began to revolve around a few specific topics. Mainly, death and coming to terms with his life, the choices he's made and whether he actually had an impact on anyone or made a difference.

&#x200B;

IT isn't an easy industry to be in. Our job is to remain invisible; only called upon if something goes wrong, meaning that we do not get a lot of recognition for the work that we do, much less feel as though we are valued. Those conversations with him made me rethink both my career and my goals in life. Why work in IT? What am I actually accomplishing? What consequence do I ultimately have?

&#x200B;

The truth of the matter is, a lot. We all have an immense amount of impact, whether we realize it or not. IT interacts with more people on a daily basis (more than most of us care to), which has a ripple effect. We help companies grow. We help people's dreams come true. We help to protect private information. We are entrusted with the proverbial ""keys to the kingdom"" and act as a gatekeeper to ensure nothing goes wrong, which also means we take on the most risk.

&#x200B;

But there's more to it than that. The fact that every single person that I have worked with has been willing to sacrifice family time, personal time and other things that they wanted to do, just to ensure that the work gets done shows true character. Even though we may not be well loved or even liked due to the strict guidelines that we have to adhere to, we are ultimately here to protect and help those around us.

&#x200B;

Derek's condition worsened and he passed away Monday evening, leaving gaping holes in many people's hearts that will never be filled. Whether he ultimately realized it or not, he had an effect on everyone around him.

&#x200B;

This post is really to remind everyone here that you are all valued, you all have an impact as well as a purpose. While our jobs can be all consuming, remembering to care for ourselves so that we can perform the task at hand is equally as important. Be good to yourselves; you never know who you'll affect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words, gold and internet hugs. I sincerely hope that Derek's story helps everyone never forget just how valued you really are.

&#x200B;

Edit #2: I just got into the office this morning and am completely overwhelmed by all of the responses. Words cannot express just how grateful I am, and I am trying not to tear up while reading all of your comments. Thank you all so much and I know that Derek would be shocked as well as humbled by your heartfelt responses.

&#x200B;

Edit #3: There's been some discussion on the post in regards to sacrificing family time, and I want to clarify this statement. We have all been in positions where something goes wrong and it is absolutely necessary to drop everything and handle it. I do not condone companies that expect their employees to sacrifice their personal lives. This is not healthy and definitely not the intended message of my post. I would sincerely hope that the takeaway from this is: yes, things happen and yes, we will all have to make sacrifices, but the most important thing is the value that everyone brings as well as self care.

iaz5bc,sysadmin,1597607735.0,"A really common problem with young IT staff, especially in their first job, is they think a lot of the work being asked of them is totally beneath them, and they want to work on the cool stuff, while simultaneously doing a terrible job at their primary job duties.

Usually when someone calls them out on the fact they're not meeting performance expectations, they lose it, since they think the job is so basic that everyone must be totally crazy.

I made this mistake. A lot of other people make this mistake.

The one thing I try to do in a leadership role is understand what's happening and try to provide context when I have to have this inevitable conversation with young IT staff. I never got this from my boss.

For example:

When I was a desktop tech, one of my responsibilities was updating inventory. This was something that was very important to the IT director. Meanwhile I didn't really care since I somehow just thought I could remember where everything was. It also wasn't convenient for me since this was before mobile devices were common so I'd have to write changes down on a piece of paper and go back to my desktop in my cubicle at the other side of the building and update this slow ass legacy database that I hated and it took forever and I wanted to learn about servers.

So here I thought I was being kept from reaching my full potential and getting to touch servers.

Meanwhile my boss thought I was totally under performing since every time he'd try to run queries on this database shit was totally whack since I was not updating it.

Meanwhile I was resentful since I didn't think I was a fucking data entry clerk.

aavocr,sysadmin,1546174657.0,"TL;DR it blocks automatic restarts completely. Period.

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\MusNotification.exe]
    ""Debugger""=""cmd.exe /c echo %DATE% %TIME% suppressed automatic reboot >> C:\\UpdateOrchestrator.log""

Modify it however you like, i doesn't have to output anything to a log file. This is just how i rolled it out in my company.

I tested this a lot and confidently say this is the most unintrusive method i know to supress automatic reboots, nag screens, update notifications and the lot.  
Windows Update uses this executable a lot. Not only for restarting, but for every type of notifications you can get about them. ""Updates available"", ""You should really install updates right now"", ""Updates need to be installed, please restart"" aswell as ""Updates cannot be installed"" won't appear anymore. Taken you are monitoring installed updates, which you should, this shouldn't be an issue.

While blocking the UpdateOrchestrator\Restart task, which basically just calls MusNotification.exe with some arguments, isn't new, Microsoft blocked disabling it in 1803. This feature has to stay for backwards compatibility, so i'm certrain this workaround won't be fixed any time soon.

---

To explain what the key does:  
The Image File Execution Options subkeys actually can control a whole lot about how Windows executes files. The Debugger key was used by a lot of scareware back in the day. It redirects execution from every executable named like the key to the debugger and appends the original executable and all arguments to it. To my understanding this process would then normally be expected to set up a debug environment and start the actual process. Which we don't. So we effectively cut MusNotification.exe out of the chain and therefore preventing Windows Update from being so intrusive to the user.

---

Bonus: If anyone wants the powershell script to monitor installed windows updates that i use in conjunction with this i can post that too.


Hope this helps anyone.


Edit: To clarify. Updates installed normally. I know about the shit-ton of GPOs you can enroll that are supossed to give you control but to my experience Windows 10 Pro ignores all of them.  
The only thing that this does is supressing notifications and automatic restarts.

I am leaving them with all relevant documention and even promised them to do minor maintenance stuff whenever I had free time, free of charge, which yielded zero reaction.
the next day I asked HR what would happen to my remaining vacation days(I have more than 80 percent unused since I could never properly take off due to high turnover and not enough IT) to which she replied it's on company's goodwill to compensate them and in this case they won't be compensating since I am leaving on such short notice, When I told them that it's literally company policy to give two week notice she responded "" Officially yes, but morally you're wrong since you're leaving us with no staff""

Law of diminishing returns: If an email has 2 questions in it, the reply will come back with the answer to only one of those questions

Law of even more diminishing returns: If an email has a single question, with two or more options offered, the reply will always be yes, with no preference offered

Law of Urgency: The time allowed for resolution to a problem is the inverse to the amount of time the user knew about their problem, before telling you about it.

Law of urgency reversal: An urgent issue that requires any small amount of work from the user, will suddenly reverse the urgency of the issue.

Law of email relativity: An email to a manager is like a space ship attempting a sling shot round a planet. It heads to the planet, disappears for an undefined amount of time and then returns with three times the urgency that it left you. 

St Peter’s law: Any mass phishing email sent to company employees, will result in at least 3 of them clicking on the links in the email, despite being warned not to, and at least 2 sudden phone calls from people asking, purely co-incidentally, to change their passwords

FFS Law: If it can go wrong, it will go wrong. At 4.55pm on a Friday.

The law of Two-steps: Any Microsoft documentation required to solve an issue will always be for the previous version of the software, missing at least 2 steps required for the version of the software you’re using.

The Quart-into-a-pint-pot Law: No matter how many times you explain it, Developers don’t grasp the concept of deleting old, redundant files to make way for new files and act surprised when they run out of disk space and don’t understand why you can’t just expand the partition size on a full physical disk, ‘like you did the other week, with that disk on a SAN, attached to a VM’. 

Law of Invisible Transference: Leaving a test machine in the hands of a Developer will transition it into a production machine that’s not backed up and crashes 10 minutes before they think to tell you that ‘its been a production machine for 3 weeks, why wasn’t it backed up?’",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q9e832/sysadmin_laws/,Sysadmin laws,General Discussion,2708,316,0.97
10jeq7w,sysadmin,1674486730.0,"This is an update from a post I made 4 months ago: [Rant: VIP wants No security - is this the hill I die on?](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xwjmww/rant_vip_wants_no_security_is_this_the_hill_i_die/)

You all assured me I wasn't crazy and a lot of you gave really good advice. I was inspired [by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10izhxb/ceo_failed_a_phish_test_and_ordered_me_to_remove/) yesterday to come back and give an update. *(I feel for that OP, because I could have written most of that myself)*

So after sharing my rant 4 months ago, I started to take take a look at my resume. I used a career coach who gave great tips on formatting my resume and I started to look for jobs. I had offers upwards of 70k more than I was making, with some even higher if I was looking to relocate (I wasn't). After about a month, a LOT of interviews, and a few offers, I accepted a position that pays considerably more with more wfh, better commute, and better perks. 

I gave a full 30 days notice, which is way more than appropriate; I didn't want to burn bridges even after all the shit I put up with. I knew my team was going to flounder, and I wanted to set them up for success as best I can. It was pretty clear my manager had no idea how to fill my position. This isn't a brag, but I was doing the work of 2 FTE - I reported to the CMO so I did uniquely marketing tasks in addition to being the Dir of IT. (part of the reason I was leaving tbh - my new job is more pay and I'll only be doing 1 job). They were going to have to hire 2 FTE just to replace me, and over the course of the 30 days it became abundantly clear that my manager was finally realizing that. I should note, they didn't even come back with a counter offer. Presumable it went to the CEO who only cares about dollars in his bank account, and didn't even offer a counter. In my discussions, they fully acknowledged that they were willing to spend more to outsource my role to multiple vendors and sacrifice quality, rather than pay me what I was worth. 

But you know the worst part. During my 30 days notice (as I was putting in extra hours and going above and beyond trying to knowledge dump), the CEO didn't say a single word to me. Not even once did he acknowledge my departure. No ""good luck"" or ""thanks for the 10 years of service"". The moment I gave notice or showed interest in wanting to be paid my fair share, I was dead to him. This is a man who used to call me multiple times a week for stupid favors and bullshit. Multiple times over the years he texted me on a Sunday evening asking me to pick him up (at his multi-million dollar mansion) and drive him to work in the morning because his car was 'at his island house'. I made housecalls to him during covid and built his spoiled son a website to get him into college. All the years of bullshit 'work family' talk went out the window the moment I gave notice. 

I feel bad for whoever replaces me. I took a look at some of the resumes, and they all seem like great innovative candidates. The company pretends to care about innovation or security - but rest assured if it costs money and impacts the execs bonuses, it's going to get axed pretty quickly. They won't implement any security measures until required by insurance, and even then they'll get cute and try and make exemptions for the execs. I feel bad for the next person who has to turn a blind eye to the illegal shit, sexual harassment and ineptness of the leadership. 

If the pay way better, it honestly would have been somewhere I could have stayed forever. But it's not worth stagnating in my career just for 'job security'. I knew in the back of my mind I should have been looking for jobs years ago, but y'all really pushed me in response to my post, so thank you!

I've never been a mac person before... but after a few days of fucking with the beautiful machine, i realized that the beauty was only chassis deep. MacOS is not made for me, it's made for regular users, and all my comforts of a Linux laptop were nearly impossible to recreate on a Mac.  

I missed my linux shortcuts for applicaitons. Launching apps with shortcuts in mac is damn near impossible... having to write scripts in automator to `super+t` for terminal? how shitty.

Got a notification today that the surveillance system could not get the size of the mailque. Found that odd tried to login to the server, root password not working. 
So i fired up xenserver to see if i could see anything from there. Luckily i was logged in to the server on the console. The root user had changed name to Firefart and the top line of my /etc/passwd looked like this:

firefart:x:0:0:pwned:/root:/bin/bash

I changed the name back to root, changed the passwords, looking over logs right now.

I've dumped out all the important data from the server.

After changing the username back and the password back everything seems to be working again. Do i nuke the system from orbit and spend a few hours on christmas rebuilding it? Or do i just patch everything and hope its okey?

9qem1c,sysadmin,1540220510.0,"So this morning, after I’ve been working myself to death on a last minute nightmare project that was dropped in my lap, I woke up sick. Not dying of Ebola kind of sick, but the kind where I know need rest or I’ll be even worse tomorrow. 

In th past, I had a manager who if I was sick or unable to be into the office, I’d just text. She’d literally reply with “ok” and that was that. 

But I got a new manager about 2 months ago. He was actually the guy who gave me the nightmare project - but that’s a different rant. 

So anyway, I not only texted him, but sent an email just to cover my bases. Within SECONDS he texts me back and has about 6 questions about where I am on my project (all documented in a ticket he has access to, by the way). I answer the most basic questions and leave it at that. 

Then my phone starts ringing. Of course it’s him. But it’s not just a simple voice call. He’s trying to FACETIME ME. We’ve never used FaceTime before in any of our interactions. I just said, screw this, I’m sick and ignored it. 

I’m making a lot of assumptions here, but it feels like I’m not only being micromanaged, but he’s trying to verify just how sick I am. This is indicative of his style. A week ago I was rebuilding a server, and he asked for hourly updates. HOURLY. On a 10 hour day, doing a job I’ve done hundreds of times. 

I think I was just lucky and my former manager was just shielding me from this toxic culture. Even in our line of work, this isn’t normal right?

Update: as I typed this out, he tried FaceTime again. I may be quitting shortly. 

Update the second: I put him on ignore. Slept like I haven’t slept in weeks. Woke up to a recruiter calling me about an opportunity with a 20k raise. I’m not saying I’m walking in with my resignation tomorrow, but  I’m on my way out as soon as the next job - wherever it is - is signed, sealed and delivered.

Full text:

> UPDATE as of February 11, 2020: On January 22, 2020 we announced that the Microsoft Search in Bing browser extension would be made available through Office 365 ProPlus on Windows devices starting at the end of February. To those of you who provided feedback, thank you for taking the time to share your opinions! Based on your input, we are adjusting our approach to better address the concerns that were raised about managing the rollout. Please note the following changes to the plan:

> * The Microsoft Search in Bing browser extension will not be automatically deployed with Office 365 ProPlus.
* Through a new toggle in the Microsoft 365 admin center, administrators will be able to opt in to deploy the browser extension to their organization through Office 365 ProPlus.
* In the near term, Office 365 ProPlus will only deploy the browser extension to AD-joined devices, even within organizations that have opted in. In the future we will add specific settings to govern the deployment of the extension to unmanaged devices.
* We will continue to provide end users who receive the extension with control over their search engine preference.

> Due to these changes, the Microsoft Search in Bing extension will not ship with Version 2002 of Office 365 ProPlus. We will deliver a new Message center post once a revised launch date has been determined, and that post will include details on the admin controls that will be available prior to launch. For additional information, please see [this blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/office-365-blog/update-to-microsoft-search-in-bing-through-office-365-proplus/ba-p/1161030) which will also be updated as plans are announced.

This was a roller coaster for me, this company acquired the company I worked for for 12 years, then let me go in less than a year. The official corporate story is 'downsizing'. About 20 people got let go from a 300ish person company.

Not looking for sympathy or pity, but just wanted to share some things I've learned over the years.

1. NEVER feel bad for taking time off, asking for more money, or quitting a job. If you don't look out for you, nobody will.
2. Have a healthy level of distrust, even in those you trust the most. It may sound counterintuitive, but when push comes to shove, they will most likely leave you to fend for yourself. Don't expect anyone to go to bat for you, but be grateful if they do.
3. Don't send an email asking something you are fully capable of figuring out yourself.
4. When you interview, ask the question 'How likely is it that this company gets sold, or part of it is sold?' I've started including that in my interviews, and I always get a 'wow, that is an amazing question nobody ever asks' and it's benefited me already.
5. Be careful when you are making a lot of money, while you may be a high performer, the numbskulls crunching numbers don't care. When you make good money, you are first to go when times get tough, be prepared for that.
6. Save money. I know this seems pretty obvious, but it's even more important now than ever. Pay yourself first.
7. It's always DNS.
8. Keep your mouth shut unless you are 100% certain it will benefit YOU directly. Fuck what's best for the company. Do the right thing for the client, but don't lose your job over it. At the end of the day, you are there to pay your bills and put food on your table.

So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.

I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.

In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...

I got an email stating ""I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day""

I never thought I could get this angry with a user, but here we are...

I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.

While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.

You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 

I hope you all had a better morning.

zzciwc,sysadmin,1672436856.0,"Hello everyone, I posted this already in [r/MaliciousComplianc](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/) and people ask me to share it here. I'm about to share my greatest work story. My native language isn't English, so please excuse when my grammar is a bit simple.

The  story starts with me and my company, I'm a 30-year-old businesswoman  who works in an IT service in a bank space. I'm the girl for everything  basically, but I'm a specialist for first level support, administration  and backup, sometimes even networking.

Even  when I'm not head of my it department, I'm basically had all the  responsibilities of them, but unfortunately my pay grade doesn't reflect  that at all. I think of my Boss of my IT department as kinda lazy if  not incompetent, he even brags about getting so much money for basically  doing nothing.

I have a 40-hour  week, but since the whole IT department is my responsibility I need to  keep track of the servers and maybe problems that can occur 24/7, this  is mostly done via emails. When the server status gives out a warning or  a failure, I will get notified, and then I'm fixing the problem over  remote desktop or going to the company itself (even in my free time). I  wouldn't mind this, but I'm not getting paid for this, but on the other  hand, I'm getting punished when something is going wrong.

My  Bosses Boss wasn't that much better. Since it was a fancy Bank,  everyone should be in a suit the whole time, to let it look  professional, best with a skirt and high heels. Only problem is when you  work in the first level support  you need to do a lot of ""behind the  scenes"" work, like slipping under the desk to do or repair cable  management, doing work on the server rack and doing lots of other  activities that makes you dirty. You can imagine that this worn out my  business clothes really, really fast and not only that, they were so  impractical and really made my work harder. So I changed my clothes to a  comfy Hoody and work pants to fit the work I'm doing a bit better. When  my Boss saw me, he was furious, demanded I can't look like ""a poor  hobo"" inside his bank. I told him that I demand work clothes for both  occasions because they are expensive and gets worn out quickly. He  refused, and I wasn't really happy about this.

So this, so much for the introduction.

Someday, my Bosses Boss (head of the whole company) called me.

He  had a plan. He wanted to create ""quiet hours"", means he didn't want his  employees working on weekends to let them rest properly. *(At  first glance, you could say : Hey, that's a nice idea. Yeah.... no, he  just didn't like to pay them for overwork, because he got in some legal  trouble with overwork paying in general. Not only that, some employees  have strict deadlines and need the extra time to get work done.)*

To  actively ensure nobody can't work over the weekend, he wanted the  following : ""Please make sure NO ONE can access their emails and remote  desktop over the weekend, no exceptions!""

Since we had a ticket system and be able to attach emails to tickets, I ask him to write and official work task. *(this  has two reasons. First, I like everything documented. Second, I have a  something to protect and secure myself if the task I was giving is  incorrect. And it's exactly this that saved me)*

So  I was in my office desk again, thinking how to get the task done and  what implication it will have and then... it was clear to me what it  meant!

The email came from my Boss with the Task and indeed he wrote :  ""for EVERYONE, NO EXCEPTIONS"".

I  was thinking to myself : Should I write them, the implications it would  have? After thinking, I thought of how I am treated as a worker and  I... decided against it.

I  was working immediately at this task and made an automated process to  block every access to emails after Friday 6PM to Monday 6AM.

Weekend  came, and it was Saturday, and I was calm relaxed because if you have  not noticed by now, by cutting down EVERYONE's emails, means of  course... that I don't receive any updates on the Servers. I can't  possibly work on it because my remote access is also cut, of course. *(IF  you think : You could forward your work email address to your private  address, no I can't because we have a very strict data protection.  Nothing is allowed to go out.)* I'm happy!

It's  still Saturday, middle of the day, I'm cooking myself and my husband a  nice meal and my telephone rings, it's my Bosses Boss!

He  talks with a stressed voice and told me that he can't access his  emails. I needed a second to process this, but I responded : ""That  doesn't surprise me at all, since you ordered me to cut EVERYONE's email  access, without exceptions"". He was angry, very angry, and told me that  this obviously doesn't count for him. I told him that he specifically  told me that they are NO exceptions, and he stated EVERYONE. He then  argued that this wasn't how he phrased it, so I reread him his own  email. After that, he was silent for a moment. He noticed his flaw in  his logic. I broke the silence and ask him : ""Sir, if you still want  access to your emails on the weekend, that's no problem, please send me a  request per email and I work on first thing on Monday."" A bit angry  again, he replied that he wants to have it done immediately, and I  calmly explained to him that I can't do this, since my remote access is  also blocked, like he ordered. He hanged up...

10  minutes later, he calls me again. He asks me calmly if I can fix the  problem right now when he pays me for my overwork. He also wants me to  be available at any time (means I should receive my emails and be able  to remote work)  and that this will raise my pay grade by a lot. I  thought that this is the perfect opportunity. I agree to that condition  and pay raise, but only when my coworkers and I finally get work  clothes. He agreed.

Since  then my work situation drastically improved and mostly only because I  Maliciously complied, well aware of the consequences of the given task.

Thanks for reading!

l430ox,sysadmin,1611507138.0,"Last couple of months I've worked on a PowerShell module that I wanted to introduce to you today. It's called GPOZaurr and a bit like its name suggests it's a tool to eat your Group Policies and tell you what's wrong with them or give you data for further analysis with zero effort on your side.

Over the years I've worked for multiple companies where GPOs were created and left forever. Ever since I've started to work for a Client that had 5000 GPOs (that's not a typo) I realized that I need a solution that I can run over and over again for years and manage them or each time something is wrong I will be spending weeks to analyze things.

Invoke-GPOZaurr cmdlet that I've developed takes a three-stage approach to deal with GPOS.

* Describe a problem - why it happens, how affected are you, how many GPOs you need to fix
* Data to analyze - so you can export
* Provide automated solution, or at the very least steps on how to fix it

It's sort of an experiment.

GPOZaurr is a free PowerShell module that contains a lot of different small and large cmdlets. Today's focus, however, is all about one command, Invoke-GPOZaurr.

Just by running one line of code (of course, you need the module installed first), you can access a few built-in reports. Some of them are more advanced, some of them are for review only. Here's the full list for today. Not everything is 100% finished. Some will require some updates soon as I get more time and feedback. Feel free to report issues/improve those reports with more information.

* GPOBroken – this report can detect GPOs that are broken. By broken GPOs, I mean those which exist in AD but have no SYSVOL content or vice versa – have SYSVOL content, but there's no AD metadata. Additionally, it can detect GPO objects that are no longer GroupPolicy objects (how that happens, I'm not able to tell - replication issue, I guess). Then it provides an easy way to fix it using given step by step instructions.
* GPOBrokenLink – this report can detect links that have no matching GPO. For example, if a GPO is deleted, sometimes links to that GPO are not properly removed. This command can detect that and propose a solution. 
* GPOOwners – this report focuses on GPO Owners. By design, if Domain Admin creates GPO, the owner of GPO is the domain admins group. This report detects GPOs that are not owned by Domain Admins (in both SYSVOL and AD) and provides a way to fix them.
* GPOConsistency – this report detects inconsistent permissions between Active Directory and SYSVOL, verifying that files/folders inside each GPO match permissions as required. It then provides you an option to fix it.
* GPODuplicates – this report detects GPOs that are CNF, otherwise known as duplicate AD Objects, and provides a way to remove them.
* GPOList – this report summarizes all group policies focusing on detecting Empty, Unlinked, Disabled, No Apply Permissions GPOs. It also can detect GPOs that are not optimized or have potential problems (disabled section, but still settings in it)
* GPOLinks – this report summarizes links showing where the GPO is linked, whether it's linked to any site, cross-domain, or the status of links.
* GPOPassword – this report should detect passwords stored in GPOs.
* GPOPermissions – this report provides full permissions overview for all GPOs. It detects GPOs missing read permissions for Authenticated Users, GPOs that miss Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or SYSTEM permissions. It also detects GPOs that have Unknown permissions available. Finally, it allows you to fix permissions for all those GPOs easily. It's basically a one-stop for all permission needs.
* GPOPermissionsAdministrative – this report focuses only on detecting missing Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins permissions and allows you to fix those in no time.
* GPOPermissionsRead – similar to an administrative report, but this one focuses on Authenticated Users missing their permissions.
* GPOPermissionsRoot – this report shows all permissions assigned to the root of the group policy container. It allows you to verify who can manage all GPOs quickly.
* GPOPermissionsUnknown – this report focuses on detecting unknown permissions (deleted users) and allows you to remove them painlessly.
* GPOFiles – this report lists all files in the SYSVOL folder (including hidden ones) and tries to make a decent guess whether the file placement based on extension/type makes sense or requires additional verification. This was written to find potential malware or legacy files that can be safely deleted.
* GPOBlockedInheritance – this report checks for all Organizational Units with blocked inheritance and verifies the number of users or computers affected.
* GPOAnalysis – this report reads all content of group policies and puts them into 70+ categories. It can show things like GPOs that do Drive Mapping, Bitlocker, Laps, Printers, etc. It's handy to find dead settings, dead hosts, or settings that no longer make sense.
* NetLogonOwners – this report focuses on detecting NetLogon Owners and a way to fix it to default, secure values. NetLogonPermissions – this report provides an overview and assessment of all permissions on the NetLogon share.
* SysVolLegacyFiles – this report detects SYSVOL Legacy Files (.adm) files.

Of course, GPOZaurr is not only one cmdlet - but those reports are now exposed and easy to use. This time I've not only focused on cmdlets you can use in PowerShell, but something that you can learn from and get the documentation at the same time.

To get yourself up and running you're just one command away:

    Install-Module GPOZaurr -Force

aph6ee,sysadmin,1549897970.0,"There seem to be an awful lot of questions recently about email spoofing, especially ""header from"" and ""display name"" spoofing and there is a lot of confusion about what technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can and cannot do. Not to mention some confusion about what SMTP allows and why... Since I have repeated myself quite a few times I wanted to compile a post. This is fairly simplified but it hopefully gets the point across.

TL;DR: No, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) won't fix all your spoofing problems and DKIM by itself will prevent nothing.

## Email Crash Course

I am not able to explain email and SMTP in detail end-to-end in the time it would take for this post but there are some core things that need to be understood before we can move on. The best illustration is to use telnet to send an email via an SMTP server (I have indented the server responses to make it more clear:)

    EHLO mycomputer.mydomain.com
        250- redacted smtp.mydomain.com [10.10.10.10], pleased to meet you
    MAIL FROM: noreply@mydomain.com
        250 2.1.0 noreply@mydomain.com ... Sender ok
    RCPT TO: user@example.com
        250 2.1.5 user@example.com ... Recipient ok
    DATA
        354 Enter mail, end with ""."" on a line by itself
    From: Bob Smith <bob.smith@mydomain.com>
    Reply-to: <noreply@mydomain.com>
    Subject: Hello World
    
    Message body contents.
    .
        250 2.0.0 wASDDusO0124297 Message accepted for delivery

The above example is not only how we send messages through SMTP but is how applications and MTAs do it as well. Let's break it down:

* `HELO`/`EHLO` In the HELO command, the host sending the command identifies itself; the command may be interpreted as saying ""Hello, I am <domain>"" (and, in the case of EHLO, ""and I support service extension requests"")  

* `MAIL FROM` The ""MAIL""  command initiates transfer of mail and identifies the sender. The address specified here is where errors are sent and will typically appear in the message source as the 'return-path'.   

* `RCPT TO` This identifies the recipient(s) and may be repeated as many times as necessary for multiple recipients. (Cc: or Bcc: would be delineated under ""DATA"".)  

* `DATA` Everything following DATA is considered to be message text until the end of data indicator (`.` on its own line followed by a blank line.) This is also where header items are specified in accordance with RFC 5322.  

  * `From:` this is the ""header from"" address and is what **will appear in most mail clients like Outlook.** It is optional and will be equal to the ""MAIL FROM"" address if omitted.  

  * `Reply-to:` another optional header item which can direct replies to a specific address.  

  * `Subject:` The message's subject as it will appear in the mail client.  

  * The rest is the message body followed by the end of data indicator (`.<CRLF>`) 

Other header items could have been included or we could have omitted any of the ones that were included. The only required items are the HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA and everything else is optional.

### The ""Envelope"" vs The ""Header""

The ""MAIL FROM"" address and ""RCPT TO"" address(es) are referred to as the ""envelope"" and you may hear ""MAIL FROM"" called the ""envelope from."" Other names for the ""MAIL FROM""  address  may include ""MailFrom"", ""RFC5321.From"", ""RFC5321.MailFrom"", and a number of others. In contrast, our `From: Bob Smith <bob.smith@mydomain.com>` above is the ""header from"" or may be called the ""RFC5322.From"", ""from"", ""display from"", or any number of other names. The ""Bob Smith"" portion is typically referred to as the ""display name"" but is mostly cosmetic (more on that later.)

**For the rest of this document:** The ""envelope from"" will be called the ""MailFrom"" address and the ""header from"" address will be called simply the ""from"" address.

## That's Allowed!?

Some things that really surprise people,

- You can specify whatever you want in the MailFrom or From address. (SMTP servers ***can*** be configured to disallow certain domains or only allow ""authoritative domains."")  
- Either the MailFrom or From address can be null (`<>`) and there are circumstances where this is actually required.  
- You can specify a name with no address in the From address (`From: Bob Smith <>`) which will show up in some mail clients as ""Bob Smith"" business as usual.  
- You can format a From address like this: `From: Bob Smith <bob.smith@example.com> <hacker@hacker.su>` which is legal with the message actually *from* ""hacker@hacker.su"" but what most mail clients will show is ""Bob Smith <bob.smith@example.com>.""  

All of this is SMTP working as intended and while it's easy to see how it can be abused for malicious purposes it's important that SMTP functions this way (why is something for another post on another day.) Which leads us into...

## Spoofing

When we talk about spoofing there are three main types:

- Envelope From Spoofing ... In envelope from spoofing the MailFrom address is declared in a way that is meant to look legitimate. Usually the header from is omitted and the spoofed address appears in both places.

- Header From Spoofing ... In header from spoofing the MailFrom is a real address the attacker controls but they declare an address in the header from that is intended to look legitimate since it's what will appear in most mail clients anyway. Header from spoofing is more likely to get through filters which we'll get into later.

- Display Name Spoofing ... In display name spoofing both the MailFrom and From are addresses the attack controls (or that have no spoofing controls) but they use the display name to make the message look like it came from someone legitimate. This is the most likely to make it through filters and while it's the easiest for a human to detect it still works way too often. It's usually used when the message requires some sort of response. If we use our example above `From: Bob Smith <bob.smith@example.com>`, ""Bob Smith"" is the display name. Usually Outlook and other clients will show ""Bob Smith <bob.smith@example.com>"" the first time you get an email from an unknown person but once you reply it will usually truncate it to ""Bob Smith"" and hide the address which makes it easy to miss if you don't notice on first contact.

When it comes to spoofing the actual email address an attacker might use one of a number of different options:

1. Use the actual address such as ""bob.smith@megacorp.com"" hoping it makes it through filters.

2. Use a misspelling of the address like ""bob.smith@megac0rp.com"" (notice the zero.)

3. Use a completely different domain but a valid name ""bob.smith@yahoo.com"" and claim it's a personal address of the person they're pretending to be.

4. Use whatever address they want and rely on user stupidity ""CeoEmail@hackersite.ru"", ""MicrosoftSupport@92n3n33.com"", etc.

The most difficult spoofing to deal with as mail administrators is display name spoofing or spoofing where nothing about the address is actually spoofed and just relies on the user to herp-derp through it (2-4 above.) 

**A note on compromised mailboxes:** Another big problem is when the mailbox of a real user is compromised (successfully credential phished, virus, etc) and is used to send further phishing messages, spam, or malicious attachments. A compromised mailbox is not ""spoofed"" since the attacker is using the actual user's credentials.

**A note to domain owners:** Sending mail from your own domain but specifying an address other than your own is not ""spoofing"" unless you're not authorized to do so or have malicious intent. If I am an admin for Mega Corp and send service messages from noreply@megacorp.com that's business as usual not ""spoofing."" Spoofing is unauthorized or malicious. 

## Protection Mechanisms

### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

In any post about spoofing or mail security recommendation number one is ""implement SPF."" Which is good advice, everyone should have SPF implemented. So what is it and what does it do?

ELI5: SPF is a DNS record a domain owner publishes that contains a list of servers from which they send email. The idea is that a receiving server sees an email from their domain, checks the list of legitimate sources, and if the server it came from isn't on the list it knows it's not legitimate.

An SPF record looks something like this:

    v=spf1 include:_netblocks.google.com include:_netblocks2.google.com include:_netblocks3.google.com ~all

Which is gmail.com's if you follow the redirect. They're contained in a txt record at the top of the domain so can do `dig <domain> txt | grep v=spf1` on Linux or `Resolve-DnsName <domain> txt | ? {$_.Strings -like ""v=spf1*""}` in PowerShell on Windows to see a domain's SPF record.

There are a bunch of rules about how they're structured and a number of different mechanisms that an SPF record can contain that I won't get in to here but ultimately they resolve to a list of IPs that can be compared to the origin of an email. 

SPF is both useful for protecting against MailFrom spoofing of your domain towards your users but also to external destinations where it could harm your brand. Ie, Microsoft's SPF record stops MailFrom spoofing from @microsoft.com not just to @microsoft.com but also to you which helps stop some fake Microsoft phishing emails.

**Caveats:**

* **SPF is only concerned with the MailFrom address.**  It is not checked against the Header From address so does not in any way protect against header from spoofing or display name spoofing.
* The SPF RFC (7208) uses the word ""SHOULD"" a lot and rarely uses the word ""MUST"" so different receiving servers/filters may handle SPF failures differently. Even if you specify ""hard fail"" in your SPF record they may accept it on failure. (Lots of receiving mail servers treat `-all` and `~all` exactly the same.)

### DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

DKIM is a key-pair signing mechanism for the header of mail messages. When you send mail you attach a signature to the message using a private key which is compared to a public key published in DNS for your domain. DKIM adds authenticity to a message and guards against tampering with the header by down-stream mail servers. One of the benefits to working on the header is it survives SMTP relaying and auto-forwarding.

**DKIM does not directly prevent abusive / malicious behaviour.** DKIM is just a signature... If I hand you a letter with my signature on it there's added authenticity; However, if I hand you a letter without my signature if there's no requirement for the letter to be signed there's no reason to be suspicious. It's like SSL, just because a website doesn't have SSL doesn't mean it's fake but it's preferred when SSL is used.

### Domain Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)

As the name suggests there are reporting and conformance components to DMARC. For this post we're only concerned with the conformance component which tries to make up for the weaknesses in both SPF and DKIM. **The DMARC record of the domain in the header from address is used if it exists.** Like the above records it exists as a TXT record in DNS.

DMARC's conformance check is called ""alignment"" and it checks that the header from is ""aligned"" with other authenticated domains on the message either via DKIM or SPF. If **either** DKIM or SPF alignment passes DMARC evaluates as a ""PASS.""

**SPF Alignment:** The domain in the header from and envelope from must be the same (or sub-domains of the same parent domain if ""relaxed"") and must pass SPF.

**DKIM Alignment:**  DMARC requires a valid signature where the domain specified in the `d=` tag aligns with the sender's domain from the header from field.

**Caveats:**

* DMARC alignment is only enforced when your policy (`p=`) is set to ""reject"" or ""quarantine"".
* Lots of receiving mail servers still do not evaluate DMARC, evaluate only for reporting, or evaluate but don't report (it's a crap shoot.)
* DMARC can mess with automated messages like Out of Office replies and/or messages where the two from addresses have different domains but are still legitimate if only SPF+DMARC are implimented. It's generally best to implement DKIM along with DMARC to avoid SPF alignment issues.

## Solutions...

* Envelope from spoofing... SPF
* Header from spoofing... SPF + DMARC, DKIM + DMARC, or SPF + DKIM + DMARC. No one mechanism alone will be sufficient.
* Display name spoofing... Advanced threat filters, transport rules, and user training. None of the mechanisms care about the display name.
* Compromised mailboxes or ""legitimate"" senders.... Advanced threat filters, transport rules, and user training.

It is the owner of the domain who implements these technologies and it's up to receivers to configure their filters to check them and take appropriate action. **If you're getting mail spoofed from someone else's domain and they don't have SPF, adding SPF to your own domain isn't going to do anything (I've seen this suggested.)**

32n9xd,sysadmin,1429069349.0,"Last week I experienced the perfect sysadmin storm.

We had been planning an email migration for weeks, POP3/IMAP to hosted Exchange. D-Day came up and everything was going swimmingly. Running around the shop switching people's Outlook over--it was a minor inconvenience for most.

Two hours in and an employee asks me, *""Hey fievelm, I can't open these PDF documents on the fileshare!""*

No big deal. Probably an Adobe issue, I'll just take a peek.

Looking at his workstation, sure enough he can't open PDFs. 

*""I'll just reinstall Adobe, probably noth-""*

*""But look, I can open them on my desktop!""*

**It's not Cryptolocker, this is just a fluke, don't panic.**

I drop everything and all but run back to my desk. Open up the fileshare and look. Hundreds of documents all unreadable, all modified twenty minutes within the same 60 second span.

**Oh dear God, it's Cryptolocker.**

Literally shaking, I logged into the fileshare NAS and disabled file sharing across the board. Everything was down.

**Don't panic. You've prepared for this. We have backups of everything, they're only a few hours old.**

Exchange will have to wait. No fileshares, the plant had come to a grinding, screeching, earth shattering halt. In aerospace manufacturing you record EVERYTHING. If you can't log, catalog, and verify every part movement you might as well go home.

But we're going to find that infected machine first.

We scoured the plant. I told everyone that we weren't turning that fileshare back on until every single machine was personally checked. It only took us twenty minutes to find the offender. We quarantined it and kept moving. It turned out to be the only infected device.

Now to check the fileshare. We segregate our data based on department, so the damage was localized to two mapped drives. One of which contains 60,000+ PDF documents. About 80% of those were encrypted. No big deal, I'll just restore from the backup.

Midway through the restore process it abruptly failed.

**What the hell, what's--**

>[New Email]

>Subject: NAS Shutting Down

>*Disk #3 Failure. RAID degraded, shutting down BackupNAS*

Oh. My. God.

I don't have spares. My offsite backups for that fileshare will take days or more to restore from. I have one option. *pray*.

I turned the BackupNAS on and cleared the alarm. I figured I would straight copy the backup to a 'safe' location and power it back down.

The longest 20 minutes of my career was watching that file transfer.

Files restored, we grabbed a brand new PC, still in the box, and brought it to the employee that was attacked with Cryptolocker. He *NEEDS* a computer for the plant to function.

Unboxed, plugged in....and it's DOA. What are the odds? Why am I being punished?

**OK, we have a spare, it's a little older, but no big deal.**

We all stay late to button up all the hatches and get things going smoothly again, but we kept asking, ""What's next?""

---> The Next Morning <---

7:00AM, coffee in hand, I hadn't even made it to my office door when someone asked me when the network would be back up.

*""What...What do you mean?""*

**\*sobs***

For reasons beyond me, our hypervisor that was hosting our Primary DC and DNS shut itself down at 4:00am.

Bringing up VMs that have been unexpectedly powered down is no fun chore. Lucky for me, everything came back up without any major issues.

Never in my career have I seen so many unrelated catastrophic failures in such a short time span.


**tl;dr:** Exchange migration, Cryptolocker, then backup NAS RAID failure, DeadOnArrival PC, ESXi host failure all within the same 18 hours.

Came into a place that has fat clients everywhere with no servers and everything MS365 cloud/onedrive. Passwords are flying around all over the place. And yes, they also used (and still use) Lastpass, which is, as we all know, compromised. When I came there, there were NO BACKUPS. Boss thought they were unnecessary because ""everything is taken care of by Microsoft"". It took me 2 months to convince him that he was wrong about that. So I did implement a backup system which is running now. Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.

Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don't understand because he doesn't tell me what he changed.

He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.

So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I'm doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I'm watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I'm not following orders. I'm not 21, I'm 52 with a ton of experience who's jaw dropped when he said that he didn't need any backups.

So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can't do anything. ""Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need"". The little minion still retains rights.The little minion also says that I did not share the backup account password with him. I did. He looked in the wrong column of the spreadsheet.

What the hell should I do?

But instead of doing that, or asking their manager, or referring to the training documentation I wrote, or sending me a message in Teams--they called the vendor and scheduled on site training... Then they neglected to inform anyone and WENT TO LUNCH DURING THE TIME THEY SCHEDULED THE TRAINING SESSION. So the team the vendor sent out wandered around attempting to find someone to train. But since no one was informed, no one knew who they were or why they were there. So they left. But they're still charging us thousands of dollars for the travel and training. And it's coming out of MY BUDGET. Pour one out for me tonight I'm losing my mind.


#Update:

I'm on my lunch break right now but short story is the vendor backed down so we're not paying anything. User got a slap on the wrist and a gentle reminder to follow SOP next time. I'll follow up again tonight when I get home.

First of all, thank you everyone for all your advice and your anecdotes and also your grammar corrections for me I guess. 

The President/CEO leads the managers meetings and when it was explained what happened, his eyes widened, he said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" 

I can't reply to everyone but I see some common questions so I figured I would answer them here en masse:

>How was an end user able to engage in a billable arrangement with your vendor without any checks and balances?

The vendor claimed they wanted to go above and beyond and offer any help that was requested... 

So we established official authorized users today and demanded they not engage in any correspondence with anyone outside of that. Also, no Invoices will be paid unless they received a Purchase Order from us.

>How did this expense end up coming out of your budget?

The director of their department still had admin privileges to our ERP and was able to change the expense approver, limit and account. I've been fighting for months to trim down the amount of admin users and this situation helped me win that fight. So at least I have that going for me.

>What was the user's question?

They wanted to know how to setup speed dial and how to transfer calls. They also asked why our boss's phone number wasn't on the extension list. We told her it's because he decided he didn't want a phone on his desk so now it's a backup. She said, ""Well that's not what he told me!""

v7ptaq,sysadmin,1654695337.0,"A long-time friend of mine was recently hired as the controller of a small manufacturing company (about 90 users). In a recent conversation he mentioned that the company has an in-house electrician/IT guy that he found kind of weird. He asked me if I would come in and take a look at their IT setup to see if things were configured properly. Having recently exited the MSP world I told him I wasn’t interested in any side work but told him I would come in, check things out, and make some suggestions but that I would absolutely not do any implementation or make any changes. It would be up to him if he wanted to take my suggestions and he would have to find someone to implement them.

&#x200B;

  

I met him at the office this past Saturday and began poking around. They had 3 physical servers running legitimate licenses of Server 2016 and they were fully patched. Their backup situation was a standard 2-2-1 configuration that seemed to be running smoothly. They were an Office 365 shop with MFA properly configured and used SharePoint with Teams for most of their storage. I checked for odd forwarding rules to make sure the IT guy wasn’t spying on anyone’s email (I’ve seen this countless times in the MSP world), and everything seemed to be on the up and up. I told my friend that honestly it was the best configuration that I have seen in such a small business. I suggested virtualization and possibly adding in a 3rd backup solution such as Veeam but assured him that his setup was actually quite decent. In fact, the only major issue I had was their lack of brand loyalty. Their laptops, monitors, printers, servers, network equipment were a variety of brands and model numbers. Nothing was consistent. That’s when the conversation went downhill…

&#x200B;

Friend: “We buy everything off of eBay.”    

Me: “Wait, what?? You shouldn’t buy used equipment for a production environment.”    

F: “Oh, it isn’t used. It’s always new equipment.”    

M: “Really? That’s weird. It isn’t reconditioned or recertified?”    

F: “No, it is always brand new.”    

M: “Can I see some of the invoices or receipts?”

We went into the accountant’s office and he pulled out a bunch of receipts. The first thing I noticed is that it was the same seller every time. I asked if we could pull up the seller and look at his account. The only thing listed was old video games and game consoles. That’s weird for having bought so much equipment from this seller, he doesn’t have any such equipment currently. Also, according to the radius, the seller was someone who lives nearby. I asked if the IT guy happened to be a gamer and my friend said, “I think so”. I told my friend that he needs to buy a video game from this seller, meet him in person, and see who it is.

Right now it looks like the attackers just browsed her inbox a little and previewed a few innocuous sharepoint files.

Last night I got the final documents to sign off on the mortgage commitment and one thing stood out to me. 

> 1.	Sign and date the attached Mortgage Commitment and wet sign disclosures. The password is the last 4 digits of your SSN.

Why? WHY? WHYYY? This is NOT how we do things. You've transmitted a document containing PSI and secured it with another piece of PSI that takes little to no effort to crack. 

Out of curiosity I pulled the hash from the PDF file using `pdf2john.py` and ran `hashcat` against it on brute force pretending I had no context and guess what? It took under 5 minutes. Knowing it was a 4 digit number it took 60 seconds, and most of that was just the tool initializing.

We have the technology for secure document exchange, PGP encryption for emails, and hell: picking up the phone and relaying a more complex passphrase. They even have a secure portal I've used to exchange documents already, but I guess putting a password on a PDF was just easier.

---

**Update** - I posted a brief update [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/itw3av/psa_stop_using_sensitive_data_as_passwords_to/g5hewh1/) but I wanted to provide some more context and my perspective on it. 

I sent a pretty direct email that I wasn't happy about this, and I shared the same numbers I did in this post (<5 minutes brute, <60 seconds knowing the number). The person who I've been working with on this (not the person who sent the PDF) and I chatted on the phone and he said he would be addressing this internally. I explained to him that nothing should be sent to me except through the portal and he agreed. We'll see what he ends up doing about it, but I plan to ask next week if anything came of it.

I work in the GxP space for a large company (a CRO for those who know what they are) and previously was the lead administrator for clinical systems (eTMF, QMS, etc.). I'm now a service manager for a few clinical and several SOX/HR systems. I explained to him that if one of my people did this I would have to follow our confidentiality breach SOP because we have appropriate ways of transmitting secure data, and this is not one of them.

What I didn't tell him is that I wouldn't cover for my people, we would address it through the process, because things like this typically are not an individual issue but a cultural issue. I talk about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/itw3av/psa_stop_using_sensitive_data_as_passwords_to/g5hhumx/) where as people become more and more overloaded they begin to compromise and mistakes can be made.

Instead of slapping someone's hand with a ruler you have to look at the bigger picture. Did the person do this because the secure portal is more complex to get into? If it takes 1 minute to encrypt and email the PDF, but 5 minutes to load it into the portal, what can be done to make the portal easier for them? If it can't be made easier, then proper training and competency assessment must be done to enforce the right way of doing things.

A company with good culture and leadership will never blame an individual, but instead address the conditions that permitted the individual to make that mistake. If the individual continues to make mistakes then that requires remediation with HR, but I treat that as a last step as long as the individual acknowledges their mistakes, learns from it, and improves. 

I've always told my team that if they fuck up and tell me they fucked up I do everything in my power to protect their jobs and deal with the fallout for them. The same goes for a production change, as long as they have my approval and it blows up then I am accountable and will deal with the fallout. The only time I won't do this is if they don't tell me they fucked up, or they didn't get my permission. 

I briefly left my current employer for another shop and returned within 6 months because it was a toxic culture that publicly named, blamed, and continued to shame people for mistakes. If someone pushes a bad commit it should be fixed, not discussed in every meeting, because then people will not take risks or push the envelope for performance because they're constantly double checking to make sure they don't have to spend another week in the barrel for a small misstep.

I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where  I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. 

I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig.

I managed to work my way up to low 40's and every time I brought up my job role, pay or workload my boss would brush it off and tell me to wait until the next year. My last straw was when he hired a level 1 with zero experience and offered him the same salary I was making.

Now? Fuck all that.

I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise.   At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker.  

""Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it""

It's that simple.  All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you.  Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a ""good job"" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in

After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime).  

That's not to say I don't do anything extra.  I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc.  That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next.  

I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.

egqcxs,sysadmin,1577537088.0,"Today I have decided to write something that has been bugging me for over a few years. I want to contribute something back to the community and like-minded colleagues & friends out there for a fresh start in 2020.

I've been working in the industry for at least 14 years, so I know what crap and politics many of you have to deal with. I've grown up from shitty helpdesk all the way up to consultant level (including director-level IT) doing what I love and enjoy the most and luckily escaped falling into the same trap narrowly.

Over the years, I have unfortunately seen many of my friends & colleagues completely burn out, have anxiety attacks or panic attacks. In almost every single one of these cases, the colleague **did not accept or even recognise the reality** of what was going on. In some of the cases, despite other colleagues telling them to take a holiday/pto, despite telling them to take stress-related leave, despite the obvious of them even taking anti-depressant tablets, the individuals would just refuse to take a paid time off.

The individual would feel the immense pressure of the business on the back of their shoulder, feeling that if they do not do something, everything will fall apart. They spend hours after normal working hours to 'catch' up but with no light at the end of the tunnel. They spend an insane amount of time doing quick patches/fixes just to please the user or manager. They say 'yes' to every single request and every ticket even if it is not related to IT to help.

Unfortunately, without a good manager to block and delegate priorities & politics, this becomes the norm and painfully difficult to support, develop & manage all at the same time. There are not many people that can handle this level of pressure & stress... I've only seen **only one other** friend of mine being able to handle this... so do not think it's abnormal... **us IT guys/girls are abused mentally without even realising what is happening**.

So for those who are in the same boat, please for the sake of your own health, follow some of this advice from the more experienced colleague.

* Do not feel you need to fix everything in one day. You need to understand how to strategise and organise your time. This is hard period.
* Take time off (that's not 1 day, but more like 2-3wks). That means no mobile/cell phones. No 24/7 contact - that is illegal in most countries & states. They do not pay you for 24/7 support. Make sure the manager or your next point of contact knows this is the case.
* Do not respond to email under any circumstances. If you are the sole person in the business, tough shit, there is no loyalty in business despite working for them last 15 years (trust me I've seen this happen). Companies will ALWAYS remember things going down but never appreciate it running flawlessly.
* Do not feel you cannot move on to another company, do not under any circumstance, burn the bridges in your existing company.
* If you are emotional or crying (like a recent post I’ve seen on Reddit, you need to leave the company ASAP. The company is toxic to your health, literally poison.
* Do not let your personal relationship burn down.

Everyone is different, but after a few years of working in the same company (typically around year 3 or 4), you become complacent. Work is easy but dull - everything else just infuriates you or annoys you. Do not let this stop you from moving on - just do it and thank me later.

Lastly, do not feel you are alone. If you are having panic attacks and fainting, unable to focus on tasks, unable to even think, talk to someone, anyone.

An edit on the comment around anti-depressants. Many of the replies have misunderstood what i meant and thus i like to clarify. **It is not about stigmatisation**, but please look at yourself and resolves things before hitting the pills. Resolve things within your means i.e. avoid working outside your normal working hours. I have seen several colleagues misusing, over dosing, not taking on time etc. Seek more then one medical professional, be wary of the cocktails of drugs prescribed. Everyone reacts differently but when doctors 'test' until you react, this messes up the body natural chemistry. **That is not to say it won't help when prescribed and used properly.**

Looks legit, right?


I got an alert about a user click on a phishing email.  Took a look at the alert and the URI originally looked legit - adobe.com, no problem.  But something was still whiffy so I dug deeper.  Tested the link - it redirected to a fake Office 365 login page hosted at Windows.net.  Holy shit. I tested the URI string from Adobe, and sure enough you can [put anything after &p1= and adobe will redirect you](https://imgur.com/bAwmPXM.jpg).  That is, sufficed to say, a huge fucking problem.

Looking further down the URI, this is actually using THREE redirects - Adobe, a server owned by the Accor hotel group, and finally a server hosted by the scammers.  The landing page - on windows.net - then submits your credentials to a compromised Wordpress at `5beauty.ru`.

I submitted reports to Adobe and Microsoft and sent messages to addresses I was able to find for Accor and the 5beauty site.  I also reported the filepmgklf domain to the registrar and site host as it appears to be owned by the scammers.

Thankfully my user didn't enter any information, but it's a good indication how smart scammers are getting and how important good filtering and good training is.

Stay frosty!

*edit* Microsoft sent back a generic ""we've received your message"" email and nothing. Unfortunately these things often get lost in between departments.  Hopefully Adobe or one of the intermediate hosts will respond more quickly.

In other news, I got *another* phishing attack email on the heels of this one.  Reported it around and Good Guy Rebrandly was on the job

Yes, doing these things takes time.  But while scammers just switch to another site, it takes time and resources to set these up.  If we all take the time to report to registrars and hosts we can quickly make it much more expensive for the scammers, and they'll go back to stealing cars on the streets of ~~St. Petersburg~~ ~~Beijing~~ ~~Mumbai~~ Dubuque, Iowa

4n3e1s,sysadmin,1465361793.0,"Hi all,

My name is Logan Abbott and I am the President of SourceForge. My company acquired SourceForge in January of this year. Some people were not aware that SourceForge was acquired, nor were they aware of our recent improvements and developments.

One user recommended that I make a full post about these changes since many people haven't heard. After reaching out to a mod to get permission (didn't want to it to be blatant self-promotion) I thought I'd go ahead with the post.

We acquired SourceForge and Slashdot in January from DHI Group (also known as DICE). The first thing we did after we took over was remove bundled adware from projects: https://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-acquisition-and-future-plans/ and https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/under-new-management-sourceforge-moves-to-put-badness-in-past/

As of a few weeks ago, we also now scan for malware in case third party developers are adding their own adware: https://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-now-scans-all-projects-for-malware-and-displays-warnings-on-downloads/ 

In the past, SourceForge has also taken heat for deceptive ads that may look like download buttons. To this end we have a full time team member that polices the site and blacklists deceptive ads that sneak in via programmatic ad exchanges. And we have not announced it yet, but in the next couple of weeks we will be releasing a self-serve tool where users can report those misleading or deceptive ads that sneak in via programmatic ad exchanges so that we can blacklist them right away. We're committed to restoring trust in SourceForge and building out some cool new features.

Any feedback or comments are welcome. I'll also answer any questions that come up.

EDIT: I'd love to hear what features/improvements you would like to see at SourceForge. Feature requests, partnerships with other open source repositories, etc.

But instead, this is what you would get:

* A high school hospital volunteer announcing he just got hired as a doctor and how excited he is. Someone points out that he's actually a high school student and a volunteer who gives directions in the hospital and doesn't actually treat patients. he deletes his post. 

* Someone casually mentions that 90% of their patients died last night of the common cold not realizing this is incredibly disturbing and uncommon and a huge show of incompetence beyond anything anyone can think of. They think this is normal and has happened to all doctors. 

* A nursing aid argues that he is a type of doctor since he works at the hospital. Much arguing ensures. A hospital janitor shows up and argues he too is a type of doctor because he works at a hospital and he unpacked a box of bandages and doctors use bandages and fuck you if you disagree. 

* a 19 year old mentions getting kicked out of the house in 3 months and is hoping to become a doctor for the salary and asks what options he has. People point out this is absurd and he gets pissed off. He says he needs to make at least 300,000 dollars a year and he'll figure it out. He's always hated science but he needs the money and how can he become a doctor in the next few weeks

* A chef unexpectedly knocks up his girlfriend and needs more income and is hoping to read some anatomy books and figure out a way to perform surgeries in his garage by looking at some old reference books he found behind a dumpster. People advice against this, but several other people say they've been doing it for years and make tons of money doing backroom surgery in their basement

* Someone is bleeding all over the floor and losing tons of blood, and put a small bandaid on it and it isn't working and the blood is still flowing and asks if anyone knows how to stop bleeding. never thinks to call 911. never thinks maybe a basic part of being a doctor is knowing how to stop bleeding. somehow never learned to apply pressure to a wound.

* A doctor comes on here and bitches because a school bus got hit by a train and they expect him to come in to the hospital on his day off to deal with the very large number of casualties. he says it is fucking bullshit he has to come in because he worked 2 extra hours last week and these injured children need to go fuck themselves.

* Someone finds some kind of sketchy ""school"" in eastern europe which says they can teach you to become a doctor in 18 months and the OP argues this is the EXACT SAME THING as Harvard medical school. 

* Someone with no training or experience performs heart surgery and the patient dies so they just hide the body and hope the family doesn't notice 

* Someone is supposed to give vaccinations but forgets about it and spends the day doing other stuff. When 100 kids get Diptheria they hide in a back room and then post about how upset they are that they got fired for it

* Someone treats a patient with the flu by amputating his leg. People on here ask why the fuck he did that, and he says he thought it made sense but now isn't really sure. He thought he'd just build the person a new body rather than fix it but forgot how halfway through.

On Friday, I saw something about obfuscating PowerShell scripts. This piqued my curiosity. I found a module on GitHub, and copied it to my laptop. I tried importing it to my PS session, and was met with an error. Our AV had detected it and flagged it, which alerted our Security team. Well, once I realized I couldn't import it, I permanently deleted it and moved on with my other tasks for the day.

One of the Security guys reached out to me later that day, and we had a good discussion about what was going on. At the end of the conversation he said, and I quote: 

> Thanks for the explanation.

> I will mark this as a false positive. Have a good rest of your day!

I left this conversation feeling pretty good, and didn't think anymore about it. Well, today around 9a EST, I suddenly noticed I wasn't able to log into any applications, and was getting locked out of any system I tried. I pinged my team about it through IM (which I still had access to at this point), and... silence.

About 10 minutes after that, I get called into my HR rep's office and get asked to take a seat while she gets the Security manager and our CIO on the line.

Security manager starts the conversation and informs me that they view my attempt at running the scripts as ""sabotage"" and is a violation of company policy. I offered the same explanation to everyone that I did on Friday to the Security guy that reached out. There was absolutely no malicious intent involved, and the only reason was simple curiosity. Once I saw it was flagged and wouldn't work, I deleted it and moved on to other work.

HR asked if they would like to respond to my statement, which both declined. At this point HR starts talking and tells me that they will be terminating my employment effective immediately, and I will receive my termination notice by mail this week as well as a box to return the company docking station I had at home for when I worked remote.

---

I absolutely understand where they're coming from. Even though I wasn't aware of that particular policy, I should have known better. In hindsight, I should have talked to my manager, and gotten approval to spin up an isolated VM, copy the module, and ran it there. Then once it didn't work, deleted the VM and moved on.

Live and learn. I finally understand what everyone has been saying though, the company never really cared about me as a person. I was only a number to be dropped at their whim. While I did admit fault for this, based on my past and continued performance on my team I do feel this should have at most resulted in a write up and a stern warning to never attempt anything like this again.

EDIT: Wow, got a lot more responses than I ever imagined I would. Some positive, some negative.

Regardless of what anyone says, I honestly **only** took the above actions out of curiosity and a desire to learn more, and had absolutely **no** malicious intent or actions other than learning in mind.

I still feel that the Company labeling my actions as ""sabotage"" is way more drastic than it needed to be. Especially because this is the **first** time I have ever done anything that required Security to get involved. That being said, yes, I was in the banking industry and that means security is a foremost concern. I absolutely should have known better and done this at a home lab, or with explicit approval from my manager & Security.

2. Your experience and certs from the 80s and 90s is not relevant. Only list the last few years to fill 2-3 pages. If we want more history we can ask. If you want to highlight your longevity you can list “x years experience” in your header/intro/cover letter. If you’re at a senior level it’s assumed that you have more experience than fits on a resume and we can talk about anything you want to bring up on the interview.  Unless the job description mentions Lotus Notes, Windows 3.1 or Novell assume you can leave that off along with any other dead technology. Listing your Word Perfect certification just makes your resume too long and doesn’t add cause. 

3. I know an amount of alphabet soup is needed to get through a lot of resume scanners but think about what you’re actually saying. If you are a senior engineer bragging about your knowledge of KVMs and serial cables, it’s going to raise an eyebrow. Stick to technologies and skills that are relevant and active.

4. No one is an expert in everything. Be honest about your strength and weaknesses, if you are a God amongst men with Intune that’s great. If you are also strong with SCCM I buy it. If you go on to talk about how you also are also an expert in firewalls, all networking technologies, Linux, Unix, and every Microsoft technology under the sun, it reads like you don’t have the capacity for self reflection or a real knowledge of the depth of the technologies.

xwjmww,sysadmin,1664997599.0,"Burner account, for obvious reasons. I’m the IT leadership at my company, (<300 employees) our entire IT team consists of myself and one other person who is in more of a help desk role. I act as director and focus on security, policies, future planning, budget, etc. To say I’m the only security-focused person at my org would be an understatement, even among my team of 2. I do all the hands-on work and implementation. I don’t have buy-in from CEO or Chairman (separate people) or execs, but they’ve begrudgingly gone alone with most of my changes, *until now.* We recently went through a hellish few months re-applying for cyber insurance policy after being dropped (which we’re required to have for certain types of business), and thanks to all my changes I’d implemented over the last few years we barely scraped by and got our policy through. We’re required to have MFA, encryption on mobile devices – the standard stuff.

Our aging chairman has finally had enough and is demanding No MFA on his devices, no requirement to use outlook, no encryption, etc. This all stems from his inability and unwillingness to learn how to property MFA every 60 days (he has 4 iOS devices, all on a different 60 day cycle). I’m getting pressure from my manager just to ‘do it, or find a creative way to get it done’. This man is a big phish by all accounts; extremely wealthy, old, known in the community. He’s almost lost money before due to a man-in-the-middle attack that luckily I caught wind of and stopped. And let’s say 99% of his device usage is....adult use. Which, fine, it’s his company I don’t care what you look at on the web – and at his age, good for him. But all these things combined make him a **big** liability for the company. I’m the only one that sees that, and the security policies I have in place are really the bare minimum by others’ standards.

I’m putting my foot down and saying I want no part of this. It’s a user-error issue, not a policy issue. I’m willing to sit with him and train him to do it the right way, but he wants none of it. My job is to protect the company, but I feel like I’m on an island here. Part of me wants to have the CEO, legal, and HR sign off on this if I do in fact go through with his request – but they’d call my bluff and sign off on it without thinking because they don’t support my policies either. MFA is just unnecessary to them.

a09jft,sysadmin,1543161408.0,"So I'm the sysadmin for a heavily cloud-based business. Management is insistent that we run minimal hardware on-premises. However, I'm making the case for running our own equipment as the company expands. One of the major things is LDAP auth for the Ubuntu machines (we run no Windows machines, Ubuntu and Mac only), which although I *could* run in the cloud, it seems far more sensible to run on the LAN. I set up a multi-master OpenLDAP cluster that's fault-tolerant and redundant; I can pull machines out of the cluster as necessary and the users don't notice.

The other major thing I run is internal DNS. I set up BIND with a master and two slaves, again designed so that machines can fail without taking out the end users.

I put in a request for a week off. Firm believers in Murphy's Law, me and my boss decide that the week off is most likely where something is going to come crashing down. So I wrote up 7 pages of notes on conceivable failures and potenital resolutions, from odd DNS issues to the primary firewall dying. For the most part my LAN runs without intervention (i.e. as it should).

So on Friday, as I was going over the plan with my (very technical) boss, he notes that I run internal DNS. He's been hesistant about this before, although I've been running these machines for months with no issues.

The conversation went something like this:

Boss: ""Wait, why are we running DNS on internal systems? I thought we went straight out to Google?""  
Me: ""The internals do forward out to Google. I run them so I can have DNS entries to run the internal systems.""  
Boss: ""Okay, what happens if the DNS dies while you're on holiday?""  
Me: ""Well, DHCP pushes out three separate servers, each of which is a VM running on separate hardware.""  
Boss: ""All in the same rack?""  
Me: ""Well, not the same rack, on different AC phases, but all running off the same UPS, but if THAT goes down, it'll take the network stack and internet connection with it. DNS is the least of your worries.""  
Boss: ""But what happens if one of the DNS machines fails?""  
Me: ""It won't do anything. I built three machines deliberately to allow the LAN to fall back to a single one.""  
Boss: ""Really? Prove it.""  
Me: ""Okay. If you want proof, let's go into the server room, you can pull the cables and see if anyone screams.""

I am still amused by the look on his face, somewhere between ""is he serious??"" and ""oh yes, I want to see what happens next!"". Sure enough, we walked straight to the server room, I point out the three VM tanks, ask him to choose one, he does and pulls both ethernet cables (host and bridge) out of the back. Happens that he chose the machine with the BIND master on it. ""You can plug those back in in about half an hour.""

We walk back through the office and nothing has changed. Everyone is still surfing, researching, committing, loading new websites, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary. He opens his own laptop, opens a few new web pages, concedes that my confidence was well placed.

I do, of course, get to comment that we had intended to run Chaos Monkey, and he's done exactly that!

A couple of hours later, I remember and go re-plug the server. Nobody noticed. And everything comes back up like it was supposed to (there's half a dozen other VMs on that machine).

pc02sc,sysadmin,1629986322.0,"Okay, let's get this out of the way first: This post is not intended to make any legal arguments. No inferences to employment or compensation law should be made from anything I express here. I'm not talking about what is legal. I'm trying to start a discussion about the ethical and logical treatment of employees.

Here's a summary of my argument:

***If your employee work 45 hours a week, but you also ask them to cover 10 hours of on-call time per week, then your employee works 55 hours a week. And you should assess their contribution / value accordingly.***

In my decade+ working in IT, I've had this discussion more times than I can count. More than once, it was a confrontational discussion with a manager or owner who insisted I was wrong about this. For some reason, many employers and managers seem to live in an alternate universe where being on-call only counts as ""work"" if actual emergencies arise during the on-call shift - which I would argue is both arbitrary *and* outside of the employee's control, and therefore unethical.

\----

Here are some other fun applications of the logic, to demonstrate its absurdity:

* *""I took out a loan and bought a new car this year, but then I lost my driver's license, so I can't drive the car. Therefore, I don't owe the bank anything.""*
* *""I bought a pool and hired someone to install it in my yard, but we didn't end using the pool, so I shouldn't have to pay the guy who installed it.""*
* *""I hired a contractor to do maintenance work on my rental property, but I didn't end up renting it out to anyone this year, so I shouldn't need to pay the maintenance contractor.""*
* *""I hired a lawyer to defend me in a lawsuit, and she made her services available to me for that purpose, but then later the plaintiff dropped the lawsuit. So I don't owe the lawyer anything.""*

*----*

**Here's a basic framework for deciding whether something is work, at least in this context:**

* Are there scheduled hours that you need to observe?
* Can you sleep during these hours?
* Are you allowed to say, ""No thanks, I'd rather not"" or is this a requirement?
* Can you be away from your home / computer (to go grocery shopping, go to a movie, etc)?
* Can you stop thinking about work and checking for emails/alerts?
* Are you responsible for making work-related assessments during this time (making decisions about whether something is an emergency or can wait until the next business day)?
* Can you have a few drinks to relax during this time, or do you need to remain completely sober? (Yes, I'm serious about this one.)

Even for salaried employees, this matters.  That's because your employer assesses your contribution and value, at least in part (whether they'll admit it or not), on how much you work.

**Ultimately, here's what it comes down to**: If the employee performs a service (*watching for IT emergencies during off-hours and remaining available to address them*), and the company receives a benefit (*not having to worry about IT emergencies during those hours*), then **it is work.** And those worked hours should either be counted as part of the hours per week that the company considers the employee to work, or it should be compensated as 'extra' work - *regardless* of how utilized the person was during their on-call shift.

This is my strongly held opinion. If you think I'm wrong, I'm genuinely interested in your perspective. I would love to hear some feedback, either way.

------ EDIT: An interesting insight I've gained from all of the interaction and feedback is that we don't all have the same experience in terms of what ""on call"" actually means. Some folks have thought that I'm crazy or entitled to say all of this, and its because their experience of being on call is actually different. If you say to me ""I'm on call 24/7/365"" that tells me we are not talking about the same thing. Because clearly you sleep, go to the grocery store, etc at some point. That's not what ""on call"" means to me. My experience of on call is that you have to be immediately available to begin working on any time-sensitive issue within ~15 minutes, and you cannot be unreachable at any point. That means you're not sleeping, you're taking a quick shower or bringing the phone in the shower with you. You're definitely not leaving the house and you're definitely not having a drink or a smoke.

So I started working as a backup admin for a big IT services company about 3 years ago. My first salary was around the equivalent of around $15K. Now I know this sounds like complete shit, but considering I live in Eastern Europe where prices are much lower than in the US, it was actually quite decent for someone with no experience (the minimum salary around here is like $6K, no joke). I've spent two and a half years working for that company and I've grown a lot, both in knowledge and responsibilities. I was even added to an exclusive club of top performing employees. However despite this, my salary grew by less than 10% during those two years. In early 2020 I was supposed to get a 20% raise, but then the pandemic came and the fuckers were like ""yeah, sorry, we've frozen all salaries"". 

So I got really pissed off and started looking for jobs. Soon enough I was contacted by a recruiter working for the vendor of the backup solution I was working with. Long story short, after several interviews, they were very impressed with me and offered me a salary of around $50K. Just so you get an idea how much that means, in my country you can buy a very nice house for $150-200K. So I started working there, it was nice for the first three months while I was in training, but after that, the workload basically hit me in the head like a ton of bricks. 

In the mean time, one of my former colleagues told me they were desperate to get someone with good knowledge of that backup solution because they were in deep sh*t as the customer was penalizing them for failing to meet SLAs and threatening to not renew the contract if they didn't get their shit together. So I contacted them and offered to work for them, but not as an employee, but as a private consultant paid by the hour. They agreed. I quit my job and went back there, December was my first month and I made about $6K after taxes, which is amazing (being a private consultant I also pay a lot less in taxes than as an employee). 

Sure, I've given up job security, but honestly who cares, when I made net in one month as much as the first six months of 2019?

i1xauc,sysadmin,1596307551.0,"We're a smallish eating disorder and chemical dependency healthcare provider. When the company was founded 5 years ago, a lot of dumb choices were made, expensive dumb choices. The idea was the company would be HUGE in a few years, but the leadership at the time forgot that takes work and competence. One bad decision was to embed Salesforce deeply into our patient acquisition/intake/follow-up processes from day one.

**Exposition:**

One thing about COVID19 is that people having to social distance made some people realize how bad they or their family members were, with respect to their disorder. No distracting events/activities outside the home let people see their own behaviors, or their family members, up close. We do about half in-patient work, and half [IOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_outpatient_program)/[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_hospitalization) programs.

Our admissions stayed stead when the shutdowns started, and have stayed strong throughout the pandemic. When you're talking about patients who are literally near death because of substance abuse or eating disorders, it's not an exaggeration to say we're essential healthcare. Our patients' disorders can definitely cause them to be immune compromised, so we stayed open and took massive precautions. We haven't had a single patient in our facilities who was positive yet, fingers crossed.

But while patients were still coming in, insurers have been sloooow to pay. Collections are tight. Charges are being accepted, but insurers are just taking their sweet time paying the accepted charges.

**The Main Event:**

Our Salesforce renewal came up, and we knew it was going to be a problem. We engaged with Salesforce about creating a payment schedule, because coming up with about $160k in one lump sum by the due date wasn't going to happen. We had 75 licenses for all our various departments.

SF absolutely **refused** to work out a payment scheme for us on the contract payment, which was separated into three product invoices, $12k, $32k, and $123k, but all due on the same date. Literally refused, I got one email response that was just ""No."" Weeks of emails back and forth seemed to be going nowhere.

I thought we got somewhere when they finally set up a conference call to discuss it, but then the finance guy for Salesforce basically said ""just pay all three invoices by the due date and then we'll be fine."" I said, ""While technically, yes, that *is* a payment plan, but I assumed you understood that the request was to break this up across several months. With COVID19, our patient count is stable but insurers are paying very slowly right now. We simply can't afford that as a lump sum."" The finance guy literally said nothing.

After 20 or so seconds our sales account manager stepped in and mentioned a couple programs they're introducing for new customers to make payments easier during the COVID crisis. I asked if we were applicable to use them, he said, ""Oh, well, no, I guess not, they're just for new customers."" I said, ""So you'll help new people but not existing customers."" he replied, ""Well, that's why we're on the call today."" I said, ""yes, it is, but I'm not hearing anything from Finance.""

The finance guy piped up, ""Like I said, all I can do is suggest you pay the three individual invoices one at a time, and as long as they're paid by the due date, then we'll be all caught up.""

I said, ""So this call has basically been just so you can say you had the meeting and made an offer, isn't it? You never had any intention of actually working with us, but now you can, on paper, say you tried. Look, if we don't work out a deal, I have to move us to another product. You can have the money over a 6 month period, or you can shut us off, and lose us permanently.""

He said, ""We'll see.""

I said, ""This is why people hates Salseforce. You have us over the barrel, and you're going to make sure you fuck us. Thanks."" I hung up.

I researched other CRMs to see what would fit our company, and luckily found one. They had all the features we need, in one way or another, they were honest about what their product did and didn't do, and they had a team that was eager to help us import our data and work out the process workflows. We went into overdrive.

30 days later, SalesForce sent us a letter that we hadn't paid, and asked when they could expect payment? I said, ""I have been telling you for months we can't make the full payment at once. I wasn't kidding, exaggerating, or bluffing. I told you $160k wasn't going to appear in our bank accounts on the due date."" They sent an email warning us that we'd be cut off in 7 days. I didn't reply. They sent another email a day before the shut off, I didn't reply. They sent a final email the day they shut us off. I ignored it.

**Hammerfall:**

11am, SalesForce shut us off. We were already on the new product, had all of Intake trained, had our processes fairly well worked out, and had begun training after-care people. We had managed to cut the seat count down to 40 people by simply not letting people have accounts ""just in case."" The next week, I swear to Ba'al, Intake had the most admissions in company history. Not by a huge margin, but a record is a record. It wasn't due to the new CRM, we just had a lot of people willing to jump in, but our intake team **HANDLED IT** with the **brand new*/* CRM system they had just started using. I can't take credit for that, our intake people are fantastic.

**Aftermath:**

It's been over two months. People like the new system more, we've ironed out the bugs, people are used to it. CEO is thrilled we pay $1,900 per month rather than the equivalent of $13k/month. Intake has a smarter system, one we designed for what we NEED rather than what we might want.

And SalesForce? Fuck'em. Don't ever think you have me in a hostage situation. I'll shoot the hostage and ask you, ""now what?""

**Addendum:** I didn't name the new CRM because I didn't want this to sound like an ad for them. They're great, I like them, they're a small company in mid-Michigan that's been around for a decade or so, and they're good honest folks, so far.

The night between Saturday and Sunday last week, they rolled out an update to the payment terminals and POS systems at all harbours. Sunday morning (I don't work weekends), I receive a desperate call from the team leader at a harbour terminal just 10 minutes from my home, so I know the staff there well, even though I don't really have anything to do with day to day operations. No payment terminals are working, cars are piling up because customers can't pay, and they have tried to reach the 24/7 IT hotline for more than an hour, with no answer, and the ferry is scheduled to leave in less than an hour. I jump out of bed and drive down there, to see what I can do. I don't work with POS, but I know these systems fairly well, so I quickly see that the update has gone wrong, and I pull the previous firmware down from the server, and flash all payment terminals, and they work right away, customers get their tickets, and the ferry leave on time.

Alright lets back out the change... and queue the Jurassic Park scene where there is a GIF saying ""Nuh uh uh"" to Samuel L Jackson. Group Policy cannot apply even to the local domain controller I am logged into. 

>The processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of network connectivity to a domain controller.

What?! I am running GPUPDATE on the domain controller I'm locally logged into? It can't even talk to itself? Nope. So I run down various things on how to allow more encryption ciphers to this policy. I even attempt to change it via the Local Security Policy but of course that's futile because as soon as you enable a GPO for that setting, you cannot change it there any longer. It's grayed out. Intended design for managing configuration drift. I try a lot of things, just a few here...

I'm at my wits end here. We've got a half dozen engineers researching at this point and even a call into Microsoft Business Support for $499 (worthless FYI, I've definitely had better experience). 

Hours more of internet sleuthing and I come across u/SteveSyfuhs and his amazing reply to someone 6 months ago. Linked here for full credit and go read it for all the juicy details that I will summarize here. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/sjop64/anyone\_else\_being\_hit\_with\_lsasrv\_event\_id\_40970/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/sjop64/anyone_else_being_hit_with_lsasrv_event_id_40970/)

The smoking gun was that potentially the KRBTGT account did not recognize AES128/AES256 encryption ciphers. I'm thinking to myself, ""No way that possible, our functional level is 2016."" But what I didn't know is that no one has ever reset the KRBTGT accounts password... ever... the domain itself was created in August 2004 before Windows Server 2008 R2 was a thing. Therefore the KRBTGT account credentials were utilizing DES or RC4 and had no idea what an AES cipher was. And this is also why only a portion of the users (albiet a large amount) were affected because their Kerberos tickets were expiring and couldn't be renewed. 

*SIDE CONVO - KRBTGT is an \*incredibly\* important account. Go learn about it here* [*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn745899(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn745899(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) *and how to perform a KRBTGT reset here* [*https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/faqs-from-the-field-on-krbtgt-reset/ba-p/2367838*](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/faqs-from-the-field-on-krbtgt-reset/ba-p/2367838)*. And for all things holy in this world, reset its password every 180-days as it's a best practice...*

Because we were having severe replication issues, I powered down all of the domain controllers except the PDC/Operations FSMO role holder and reset the KRBTGT account PW. I then rebooted it so that AD would also be forced to perform an initial sync since there were no other domain controllers online (about \~20 minutes FYI). 

And holy shit. Instantaneous improvement. The modified GPO applied allowing RC4 and I quickly powered back on each of the other controllers. No more KDC encryption errors, no more credential popups, no more replication issues... home free. 

I still have some minor cleanup. AD has a terrific ability to self heal once you resolve any configuration errors or remove obstacles so that's really helpful. One branch DC is refusing to play nice so I think I'm just going to kill it and redeploy. One of the benefits of properly segmenting services. 

I'm writing this so that hopefully someone in the future sees this and SteveSyfuhs post. And if I messed up any explanations feel free to comment and I'll correct them for any future Googlers.

koicev,sysadmin,1609532742.0,"A lot of younger people who find themselves doing desktop support, perhaps at a small company, often post about how their goal is to eventually work in a data center.

I think they often know what they want, but they're not expressing it well. What they really want is to be in a higher level position where they can play with and manage bigger more complex systems.

The thing is, none of this actually happens *IN* a data center.

I think however they believe that this is where all the magic happens and where they want to be.

Yes, you want to work for a company that has all that gear but you don't want to be physically there.

You actually want to be as far from a data center as possible. They're noisy and loud and not particularly hospitable environments for humans.

Usually if a company is large enough to have one or more data centers (as opposed to a server room) they're large enough to staff the data centers.

The people who actually staff the data centers generally are there to maintain the facility and the physical side of the equipment. They rack stuff, they run all the cables, they often use automated procedures to get an OS on the hardware. They also do daily audits, monitor the HVAC equipment, sign visitors in and out, provide escorts, deal with power, work with outside vendors, test the generator once a month, do maintenance on the UPS units or work with vendors to do so, etc.

It's a decent job, but it's probably not what most of you want.

The sysadmins/engineers/whatever you call them generally aren't anywhere near the data centers. At my company (and similar at many others) the sysadmins aren't even allowed in the building without an escort from one of the data center technicians. 

The really big boys like Google and Amazon and others have datacenters all over the world, but the good jobs are not there. Their good jobs are in office buildings in major cities.

So, long story short, think about what you really want. It might be that what you're actually saying when you say ""i want to work in a data center"" is that you want to work for a company big enough that they have dedicated people working on vmware, linux, storage, exchange, whatever but you just don't quite know how to express it.

Datacenters may look cool to those early in their careers, but the people doing the type of sysadmin work you likely want to do are not actually in those data centers, at least not on a daily basis.

I have been hanging out at my current employer mostly out or habit and because my boss and my immediate coworkers are just incredible.  I don't have coworkers.  I have close friends I happen to work with.  Plus I've been here forever,  But the amount of process and paperwork I need to do for the simplest little thing is truly overwhelming at times.  There's mitigating risk and there's put a complete chokehold on innovation.  There really have been times where I have thought that it's not worth the bullshit and it's time to polish the resume.

But anyway...

The way a company reacts to a crisis like this I think shows how much it values it's employees.

3 weeks ago, they started recommending people start working from home.  I would say 50% of our workforce already worked from home for at least 3 days a week, so we had a good VPN solution in place.

Last Monday they mandated working from home for everyone who was able to.

Last Friday they announced they were cutting hours for people that still had to come into the office for their safety, but they would continue to pay them their regularly scheduled hours.  They also announce that if your job requires you physically come into the building you will be getting a $1000 bonus for your commitment.

And today they announced that they will not lay off any employees in the company for any reason other than employee misconduct through the end of calendar year 2020.

Sadly, they could not make a similar commitment for contractors.

But after today's announcement, I'm ready to do whatever it takes  make sure my part of the IT infrastructure stays up and running through this crisis.  It's a huge weight off my chest knowing I'll be able to pay my mortgage for the rest of the year.

An new appointed director along with some of the  old directors took over the company due to irreconcilable differences. It sounds like a bad divorce.

The guy had been in charge of the company for 15 years. Hired me pretty much the day they went into business. I watched the place grow, I grew with them. He was the driving force, and was liked by all.

90% of what I know today, is because this guy let me grow on the job. Been through the cryptolockers, been through the busted hardware, bad employees, the new tech, the DOD requirements etc, fixed it all, made it happen, was allowed to work it through at my own pace, and as long as goals were met, no issue.

Immediately nothing changes for me. Everything is the same, but I feel an emptiness that will be hard to get over. I fear for the future though.

Me and my coworkers have been working 14+ hour days for the last week (including the whole holiday weekend), to clean up our clients and restore them where needed. I'm proud of the work we've been able to do to get so many companies up and running again with minimal impact.  


For me at least, I cant stand the thought of a company or user feeling attacked, seeing their hard work destroyed, and then having that data held as ransom by some thugs in Russia.  


I was positioned to make that right this week. To reverse the damage by restoring data and servers from the backup systems we run. Or to reimage or rebuild machines with the deployment tools we configured. Or to simply reassure users that the security software we installed successfully prevented any damage.

feehqd,sysadmin,1583506207.0,"I am beyond fed up with Sharepoint online and recommending our company use it is probably one of the dumbest moves I've made in my career so far.

We've had many issues with SharePoint online since we migrated. Things like:

* Users using the Excel desktop apps losing changes to their workbooks
* OneDrive Sync client randomly recreating folders after they are deleted or moved causing a mess
* People not being able to save changes to files in Word/Excel
* Folders created using Sync client can't be deleted off the user's computer because of a reparse point error. Only way to fix it is running scan disk on the user's computer
* OneDrive sync client randomly stops working without any indication it's not working. So it won't save any of your changes back to cloud unless you restart it, but the OneDrive icon is there in the taskbar and indicates everything is fine
* Extremely slow sync times with the sync client, 1 hour+ for a file to be saved to SharePoint/OneDrive

I've been going back and forth with their support on these issues for close to a year and have gotten nowhere. Today I was finally told they won't escalate my tickets or offer me any more support because they say our file paths in SharePoint are too long. This is what a basic file path looks like in our environment (this is in the default document library that comes with team sites):

YEAR - Customer - Project\\Drawings\\electrical drawing 01.pdf

This is because support told me sharepoint online has a path limit of 260 characters and after the path is URL encoded, and a bunch of parameters are added to the URL, a path with as little as 60 characters will be too long for Sharepoint to support. This then gives their support an excuse to refuse to work on ANY issues we have with SharePoint online.

If you're seriously considering SharePoint Online to store your files do yourself a major favor and don't.

 User: I used to get pizzas when I ordered them, now I’m not getting them. It has to be a road issue.

 Me: As I said, the roads are fine. Where are you getting pizzas from?

 User: I’m not really sure. Can you check all places that deliver pizzas?

 Me: No I don’t even know all the places that deliver pizza. You need to narrow it down.

 User: I think it is Subway.

 Me: It’s not the roads, the roads are fine. I’m pretty sure Subway isn’t the place.

 User: I don’t know. Can you allow pizza from all Papa Johns to me?

 Me: No I can’t do that. Can you get me an address for Papa Johns?

 User: No, I only know it as Papa Johns. Can you get me all the addresses of all Papa Johns and I’ll tell you if one of them is correct?

 Me: No, I don’t have time for that. Okay, I looked at the local one and it looks like they have sent you pizza in the past and they are currently allowed to send you pizzas. Try ordering a pizza while I watch.

 User: Yeah still no pizza. I’m guessing they are getting blocked at the freeway. Can you check the freeway to make sure they can get through?

 Me: No, this is a local delivery. They aren't even using the freeway.

 User: HEY! PIZZA JUST SHOWED UP!

 User: (To everyone else they know) I apologize for the delay in the pizza but there was a major road issue that was preventing the pizza from getting to me. The network engineer has fixed the roads and we are able to get pizza again.

He never says what he tries, just that ""it's not working"". No troubleshooting, just straight up escalation. Then to be an absolute top tier ass, he CC's the user, and our boss when escalating it so as to properly make sure everyone knows that it's out of his hands and that it stays escalated.

He did this to me this weekend with a panic about something that he had to complete by Monday morning. Now, I'm a salaried employee, and he is hourly, so me being interrupted on the weekend for work he should be doing is literally me doing free work so he can get paid OT.

&#x200B;

So, I first send a reply all that says ""here's what I see-looks like this value is entered as x, when it should have been y-just swap it out and you should be golden"". I'm not wanting to go back and forth and this should be the end of it. But I know that because of the way he escalated it, he undoubtedly convinced the user that it's a really big technical issue and the only way it could be fixed is by someone with a deep level of understanding, and there's no possible way he could make this mistake, so he replies all with ""well, now that I'm testing it, it's still not working"". I'm almost certain he's replying from his cell phone.

&#x200B;

I know it will work, because I literally wrote the user guide that he didn't read. I'm also grumpy about working for free, and I'm putting in my notice later this week, so I'm not particularly worried about being nice-only that I'm being professional and still  providing ""teachable moments"". So instead of just putting in the 3 minutes of work to do his job for him, I dig into all the access logs, pull up the searches for where he didn't perform any testing but claimed he did, and then pull up the audit logs that show he didn't actually make the changes I recommended, then contrast that with the logs for when I tested it and what the audit looks like when I made the change, showing the before and afters exactly as I predicted it, all in the most matter of fact outside auditor tone, complete with screenshots and highlighted logs CC'd to our boss, his tier 1 peers and the user.

Interestingly enough, I don't see any other entries like this aside from the one at 1:15PM.-2:11PM is my entry in the audit logs, and that's where I logged in and saw that it hadn't been changed, so I changed x to y.-2:12PM is my test, and it's working. And here's what it looks like in the logs.

Let me know if your tests are revealing something different. Please attach the logs and we'll go over them together to get to the bottom of it!""

Long story short-don't try to throw the bus driver under the bus.  


Edit- A couple points on this post that may add some context:

&#x200B;

T1 has been at the job for 6 years or so, and the practice of CCing users and bosses has rewarded him well. He also never actually escalates tickets by re-assigning them, he just emails everyone, lets them do the lifting and then closes tickets under his name. The dude's entire MO is about making himself look good and taking credit for other people's work. Management only sees good numbers from him, and users see how he gets results by escalating everything so in management's eyes he's doing nothing wrong. The organization's escalation process is broken and the powers that be refuse to correct it, instead using the term ""white glove"" service when they really mean ""blue latex glove"".

&#x200B;

The system is not very complex in the grand scheme of things. I've written extensive KBs on how to do things and what steps you can take to troubleshoot with series of ""when users do this, here is the expected result and here are various things that may happen and what to do in the event of them"". I also get that reading KBs is not something everyone does, because honestly not everyone documents and it's a pleasant surprise to see well written guides. 

&#x200B;

I also did see, but declined to mention in the audit logs an inactivity logout from his session.

&#x200B;

The ticket he had was given to him on Wednesday, and he didn't do his first bit of work on it til Sunday afternoon, then decided to make it my issue after sitting on it. I'm not mad that someone sits on work and soaks up overtime on the weekend-the company has lots of cash, and I'm all for people getting paid.

What pisses me off is asking for a helping hand, but really meaning that you want someone else to do the work and then having the audacity to say I'm wrong when I absolutely am not and lie about work he didn't do to make himself look good \*at my expense\*. A simple explanation like ""oh, I just stepped out-can you update it for me?"" would suffice.

7r1824,sysadmin,1516198557.0,"Yesterday, Google released coursework on Coursera for the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. Google's blog post regarding the release can be found [here](https://blog.google/topics/grow-with-google/it-support-professional-certificate/?utm_source=HPP&utm_campaign=IT%20Cert). The coursework itself can be found on Coursera [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-it-support).

The TL;DR of it is that the self-paced course is $49/month and offers a total of six courses to complete the track. The certificate asserts that the recipient can fulfill entry-level technical support positions in enterprise environments. Course titles include:

1. Technical Support Fundamentals
2. The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking
3. Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User
4. System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services
5. IT Automation: It’s not that scary!
6. IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts

In my opinion, this is an interesting move by Google. If the courseware is high-quality and tries to be as vendor-neutral as possible, it might be able to supplant CompTIA's A+, which has had issues with remaining relevant on a resume since a considerable portion of the material is considered legacy technology by many organizations.

I know many on this subreddit are past the points in their career where this certification would add any kind of value to their resume, but I'm interested in hearing opinions about how this might impact the IT ecosystem - especially from those of you in management positions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7r1824/google_launches_its_it_support_professional/,Google launches its IT Support Professional Certificate,,2166,700,0.96
ogg6ga,sysadmin,1625777472.0,"Been dealing with this the past few days. 2 days ago our on-call person got flooded with alerts around 7 pm. Looked like an internet outage or power outage because all of the monitored devices went out all at the same time. They did what they could remotely but couldn’t get things running. They called the ISP and the ISP (in typical fashion) swore up and down there wasn’t an issue on their end. They said they also weren’t able to reach their modem. We supposed it could have been a power outage but the UPSs should have alerted us of going on battery power. Whatever, it wouldn’t be the first time an ISP had lied to use. Oncall was able to reach someone and let them know there was an issue and we thought it was internet related. Customer said not to worry about it until first thing in the morning if the internet wasn’t back up. We asked them to reboot the modem when they got in. They said they would. 6:30 am rolls around and all of a sudden all of the servers come back online. 

Our assumption was that they rebooted the modem and everything was all good. Then it happened again the next night same thing. Now we were really confused. Something must be going on. Let the customer know something was going on and I told them I would be onsite in the morning (today). After going through log files and configured, all I could figure out was that for some reason at the same time every night everything shut off, and not gracefully. All of the logs stopped and started at the same point and never said anything about shutting down. 

Thinking it was an issue with the PDUs, I checked the configuration and logs on that and again, nothing that would make me think it was a scheduled thing. 

At the end of my rope, I checked the door logs for the server room. It showed someone entering right around the time that the power went off. Well that was something. Unfortunately they just have a number pad with only one code. Next thing I pulled was the camera log for the one covering the door (unfortunately the only one in the server room). Low and behold there is camera record. To my surprise I see the owner walking through the door. 

Luckily it was a slow day so they were able to talk. I knocked on their door and asked if they had a minute. I filled them in on what had been going on. Then a small grin crept onto their face. They said, “I know exactly what’s going on. Every night before I leave I go in the server room and turn everything off for the day. No one is here using the equipment so there is no sense in wasting electricity.” Their method to “turn things off” was to flip the physical switch on all of the PDUs. 

*FACEPALM*

It was a fun conversation explaining the need to keeping servers running and also not turning them off by flipping the switch on the PDU. They seemed to understand but didn’t like that there would be wasted electricity. Now they want me to find a solution for them that gracefully shuts off everything that isn’t absolutely necessary at night. 

I’m at a loss. Need to find a way to tell someone they’re a moron without getting fired.

He came into work, realized it wasn't working to sign into this PC, and spent the next 25 minutes trying to troubleshoot the issue.

pamx4w,sysadmin,1629810284.0,"I’m about to hit 40 and like a lot of 40 year olds, I get up early for no reason at all other than to have coffee and start my day on my own terms in some peace and quiet (why do IT workers enjoy silence so much?)

This got me thinking of my 22 years in IT. From 10+ years of imposter syndrome to overstaying at a job due to fear to finding myself at 40 with a job that loves me, awards and acknowledges me and pays me well over what I thought I would ever make.

I see a lot of young and old sharing in journeys that I have travelled through myself. I see way too many people sticking it out into later years at a job that doesn’t pay or respect them, thinking they can’t get better elsewhere (hint: I promise you can).

I figured some may be able to learn from my journey and at a minimum, it may speak to other middle aged folks who have travelled a similar road. This is going to be a bit lengthy, brevity is certainly not something I’ve learned over the years.

I was lucky enough to get an internship at 18. I grew up in a lower middle class home where the only computer in the house was the one I paid 1600 dollars in 1997 money (something like 2800 in current dollar form). A pentium 2 350mhz beauty. When I went to buy it I had very little understanding of how computers worked. All I knew is I loved computer games, the internet was a cool and weird place and ICQ and intern forums/culture were what I was all about.

Anyway, shortly after the internship was offered I had a panic attack. I called the person who offered me the job and told them I know nothing, this is a mistake and they’re going to regret it. Thankfully, they reassured me and told me I was 18 and they didn’t expect me to know anything, that was the point of the internship. I took the job and worked as a paid intern during my 4 years of college (doing nothing computer related at all, because i sucked at math).

This internship was a good experience but also an extremely anxiety inducing time. I knew my technical skills weren’t great so I focused on my people skills and building relationships. I listened a lot more than I talked. I asked people how they were doing when I went to work on an issue or swap a monitor or setup a docking station. I never complained and took whatever job they told me to do (I’m surprised I still have a back after countless laserjet 4 series moves. I still believe they only stopped making these models as they were cheap and easy to maintain and were built like a tank.)

My direct boss was their lead technician and he was often an incredible ass. He had no ability to teach or guide. He was often grumpy and I was constantly walking on eggshells. He was also incredibly talented and bright, which made me feel all the more dumb. 

I also ended up driving him home almost everyday. It was a bit like an abusive relationship, looking back on it. I was younger, he was 40. He had the knowledge I wanted to have and respected him. Instead of helping and teaching, I was getting constant stomach aches from worrying and trying to figure out if he was going to be a dick or actually be nice to me when he could tell I was near a meltdown.

Anyway, I leaned a lot about computers and business settings during that four year stint. I also was given a deep feeling of anxiety with a hefty helping of imposter syndrome, likely due to working with an emotionally abusive manager day in and day out. 

Once I graduated, the internship program had to come to an end. Folks there really seemed to like me and they wanted to get me a full time role, but the company was in a downward slide and I had to find a new path of employment.

Narrator: “Are you bored yet? Too bad.”

I connected with a recruiting agency and went in for a level one helpdesk role in a very new market, Managed Services for small businesses (under 200 seats, max). It’s hard to believe this industry didn’t exist in any large form in the early 2000s. It was a crazy idea, small business outsourcing all of their IT?! This is never going to work!

This was my first interview I had taken after my internship. I asked a lot of questions, failed a lot of their technical questions but they still offered me the role over others as they liked my curious nature and my ability to think logically through problems, even if I didn’t know the answer.

I was flying high. 32k salary, sharing an apartment with two friends and drinking ourselves stupid every weekend. Being able to afford a fancy frozen pizza from time to time, I was rich!

The helpdesk role was a terrifying but essential role in my life. I learned about Active Directory, how to work with complete strangers, how to make a person feel like they’re not dumb for not knowing IT (your job is to know your job, my job is to help you to be able to do your job. A line I used all the time).

Surprisingly, the leadership was heavily invested in culture and building a place that people wanted to work at. We were all young, the business was doing well and the salaries were pretty fair for a lot of young people who liked technology. We had holiday parties at fancy locations. We were allowed to have LAN parties in the office. We were all learning together and buildings friendships as well as a business. 

I spent 8 years with this MSP. I moved from level 1 helpdesk to level 2 helpdesk, moved from level 2 helpdesk to manager of the helpdesk, moved from manager to level 3 support (who knew being a manager was a miserable experience? Firing and hiring, upset customers, being responsible for the actions and behaviour of others, having to set an example and avoid making friendships with employees, I hated it). From level 3 support to my first “real” sysadmin role. I was now making 50k a year. I felt like a Saudi prince. I had never imagined such a salary was possible. 

I stayed at the MSP for 8 years. The work was hard. Dealing with upset customers is hard. Not knowing an answer to an issue is hard. I often felt like a complete fraud even though the business kept promoting me and telling me I was great at my job. 

I was afraid to leave as I knew I knew nothing. It was a fluke that this job was going well. All I did was Google answers or brute force my way to a resolution. What kind of skilled tech uses Google all the time to hunt for answers? If I was a true skilled technician, I would just know the answers already. I would never find a better job and if I tried, they’d find out what a fraud I was and I’d never work in IT again. I’ll be off working retail, stocking shelves and making 8 dollars an hour for the rest of my life.

At this stage or my life, nearing 30, I had a friend who I really admired who gave me some great advice that I took to heart. It was something like 

“Listen dude, the people who are good at IT are often the people who don’t think they are good at IT. How many people did you fire who seemed to think they were IT experts? If you’re smart enough to be aware that you don’t know things, you’re way ahead of so many other people in this industry.”

I thought about that a lot. Through the past 10 years, I realized how true his perspective is for IT as well as many other areas in life. For instance, people who worry about being a bad parent are almost always good parents. If you are smart an insightful enough to realize you have many failings, you’re aware enough to see those failings and to work on them. Bad parents never even consider that they are a bad parent at all. That’s the key difference.

Powered with that feedback, I update my resume and started taking interviews. I was offered a role as a “true” systems administrator at a successful mid-sized business. I was still incredibly anxious and afraid, but I was finding a bit more confidence in myself.

I learned VMWare inside and out. I picked up the Atlassian suite of tools and became fluent with their product set. I became our “expert” on SharePoint (for better or worse). I learned about VoIP and managed all phones and call center design. Many mistakes were made in this journey but through every mistake I learned something new. My manager supported me and told me that the only way to truly learn is to just “do”. You will break things, you will make mistakes, and through all of that you become a better admin.

The only time he would ever get upset is if you made the same mistake twice. Once is a learning experience and is accepted. Twice is simply not learning from your mistakes and is not acceptable. This was great advice and something I still use today. You will break things but you will learn. 

This thought process also flipped a switch in my brain. I often had terrible documentation and notes. I realized that if I want to learn from my mistakes, a key part of that journey is documentation. I learned to love OneNote. My team learned to love OneNote. Through documentation, I realized I didn’t have to remember every detail about everything. I could let those memories go and fill up my brain with new technology and ideas. The OneNote was always there waiting for me if I needed help.

I stayed at this employer for 5 years. I leveraged interviews with other companies to get raises. I learned that companies rarely promote from the inside anymore and infrequently give large salary increases; Unless they’re afraid you’re going to leave.

I learned to negotiate. I started viewing myself as a corporation of one. Money wasn’t personal, loyalty wasn’t personal, leaving jobs is not personal. It was all just business.

I leveraged an offer with another company to get a raise at my current company. I told my boss I loved working here and the company is great, I just need to make the right financial choices for my family. By taking this path, I made it about money and family, something everyone understands. By stating my love for the company and my work, I was able to put them at ease. 

Through these tactics, I went from making 50k to making 85k, overnight. I was shocked and dumbfounded. They literally gave me a 40% raise by simply advocating for myself. 

As I said, I spent 5 years at this business and learned all their tools inside and out. After 5 years, I just have nothing much to learn. I was just coasting and existing, surfing Reddit and solving problems as they came up. I wasn’t learning or growing.

This job also taught me a lot about culture and the value of having strong culture at your workplace. People were kinda sad looking. No one seemed to be excited about our office, their work, our products and the company matched that vibe by spending nearly nothing on building culture and a positive workplace.

My previous job was full of LAN parties and heavy culture support by leadership. They opened their wallets to make a fun environment. They spent at least 250k a year on employee enjoyment and enrichment. I felt valued there, I felt the owners cared and spent money they didn’t have to spend to endure we felt appreciated and engaged.

This is when I learned that culture “mottos” and business tag lines are workless. If your company says they want a good culture but doesn’t spend money to make it happen, they simply do not care.

During that final year, I was head hunted by a Fortune 500. The salary put me at or close to six figures, they had great budgets and the industry was exiting. I put in my two weeks. My boss once again offered to give me a raise to match or exceed the offer. I declined. As I said, I learned the environment too well and needed a larger challenge.

This puts me to modern day. I’m 40, making more money than I ever thought possible. I am valued at my job, people are happy at my job and IT is truly valued. The business knows that technology is a huge part of their success and we’re encouraged to work outside our comfort zone. We’re encouraged to reach out to senior leadership directly. We’re directly told not to overwork. I put in my 40 hours and I stop working. Here or there I have an after hours project…but by and later, I work less hours and get paid much more. For now, I’m happy and I think I’ll be here another 10 years. I could see the possibility of working here until retirement, when I place my badge at the security desk, tip my fedora a hefty m’lady and shamble out the door for the final time.

If this story was helpful to you, I’m glad. If it was boring, sorry for wasting your time. If it took you down memory lane for a few minutes, I hope you enjoyed that trip.

I'd like you to know:

- ADHD is misnamed. It's not really about Attention Deficit or Hyperactivity, that's just two of the first symptoms seen in children. It doesn't get renamed because it's in legislation (including the ADA). 

- It's about Executive Function, and in Adults that shows up differently. It can be a hyperactive brain. It can be difficulty maintaining concentration. But it can also be difficult to _stop_ concentrating on something that you find fascinating. Most adults can 'get by' if they've only a mild form of this disability.  (I did for 30+ years). 

- Not all children obviously have the 'stereotypical' ADHD, and they get missed. 

- It's about 5-10% prevalence in population. Because of the stereotypes, a lot of children get missed and go undiagnosed. There's a pretty good chance that you know someone with it. (In the UK especially, there's a 1% diagnosis rate, which is a huge gap. The US is somewhat ahead on this)

- Because of the nature of the disability, certain types of career are better suited to people with it. It's my personal belief (based on my 20 years of experience) that sysadmin is one of these. Automation (and creating automation) and ticket queues in particular are ""helpful"". 

- It's a very manageable and treatable condition - Medication is effective and well understood and there's a lot of workarounds and coping strategies that also help avoid the things that are disproportionately difficult. 

- It's good to talk about mental health - it's not a big scary thing. Chances are every single one of us has been depressed, anxious or stressed at least a few times in our lives. ADHD can also make it a bit easier to slip into these, simply because you're working harder. 

Anyway, if you've any questions, I'll answer what I can. I'm no expert or anything, just an IT geek who's figured out why certain things have been abnormally difficult for most of my life.

**EDIT:**
I wanted to thank you all for your comments, I wanted to update this with some of my observations.

From what I've learned reading through all the comments on this post, (especially the 1-2 vote comments all the way at the bottom), it seems that we can all agree that this sub can be a little more professional and useful. Many of us have been here for years, and some of us think we have seniority in this sub. I also see people assuming superiority over everyone else, and it turns into a pissing contest. There will always be new sysadmins entering this field, like we once did a long time ago. We've already seen a lot of the stuff that new people have not seen yet. That's just called ""experience"", not superiority. 

I saw many comments saying that people should stop asking stupid questions should just Google it. I know that for myself, I prefer to get your opinions and personal experiences, and if I wanted a technical manual then I will Google it. Either way, posting insults (and upvoting them) is not the best way to deal with these posts. 

A post like ""I'm looking for the best switch"" might seem stupid to you, but we have over 100,000 users here. A lot of people are going to click that post because they are interested in what you guys have to say. But when the top voted comments are ""do your own research"" or ""you have no business touching a switch if you don't know"", that just makes us look like assholes. And it certainly discourages people from submitting their own questions. That's embarrassing because we are professionals, and the quality of comments has been degrading recently (and they aren't all coming from the new people). 

I feel that this is a place for sysadmins to ""talk shop"", as some of you have said.

After about 8mos I was able to get back to work and was offered a position as a SysAdmin for a local hospital group at a pretty good rate. Not as much as I was making in Indy, but still for the area $36.05 was not bad.  

I began work on July 6th of 2016 and fit right in with the IS team who were a great and fun bunch of guys. Worked my ass of to get up to speed on their VMWare enviro and all the different PoC applications they had deployed and was getting pretty comfortable with all of their processes.  

Anyway, about 2 weeks before Christmas I get an email from HR asking me to give them a call, that they needed to speak to me as soon as possible. I was thinking they must be having some issues with their time keeping apps or hardware and were looking for input as to what hardware might be needed for an upgrade. You know, standard IS stuff so no big deal.  

So I confirmed a time that day to meet with them, and I drove over to the other hospital where HR was and got to sit in a small hallway with what appeared to be 1.5"" thick plexiglass with a slot on the bottom and a speaker/Mic setup to communicate with the person behind the plexiglass.  I waited about 30min and was finally asked back.  

Now realize I spent 8+yrs in the military, 2.5 with the 82nd Abn. and 4+ with 5th SFG. all of which is documented on my resume and backed up by my 214, and toss in that I am 6'2"" and 235lbs and you actually have an extremely nervous HR dept., so nervous in fact that the HR Director, who actually SHOULD have been the one speaking to me, pushed it off on a sweet young lady who was so scared for what she was about to do that she couldn't even look me in the eye as she informed me that ""They had made a mistake and hired me at a higher rate than they meant to and that they would be reducing my Hrly rate by $5.25 cents, but not to worry, it wouldn't take effect until the first pay period of the new year...""  but that ""I had a chance to make it back through bonuses and annual raises."" 

Now looking across her desk, I could see all of the notes that she had and could see very distinctly that the action was initiated ""Due to a complaint by my immediate supervisor due to me making more an hour that he was. So, I just laughed and said ""Well, I guess there's not a whole lot I can do about that, but thanks for making me feel special."" and I got up and asked if I was dismissed and she said i would be right after I signed a form that stated I had been notified and explained the situation, standard HR bullshit junk. I signed and then left.

Fast forward to Christmas 2yrs later when I was able to land a job with another healthcare group.  I called HR, set up an apt. and gave them my offer letter from my prospective employer which was about 5K above what my salary was prior to them, reducing it.  The Rep excuses herself for a moment and this time the HR Director decides to come in and talk to me.  He gives me the same old ""Times are tough right now, blah blah blah, what can we do to get you to stay, blah blah.  I told him that he should have thought about that before he took $5.25 away from me 2yrs ago. He lets me know he will need to speak to the IS director and my Supervisor and see what they can come up with.

So the next day, I am called back in and he offers me $2.50 and hour immediate increase, a Title change and in 6mos if my supervisor agrees, another $2.50. Now keep in mind, this doesn't even match the offer I put in front of him, but I liked my job and especially the people I worked with so I said ok, I can live with that.

FF 4 weeks later. Still no increase, no title change, nothing. When I asked my Sup and then Director what the hold up was, they  say HR is dragging their feet. So I contact the person who offered me the position I put in front of them 30 days ago and asked if it was still avail. He said yes, so I told him I will take it.  Then I notified my Director I was leaving due to no movement on the promises that were made by HR. HR Director calls me asking me why I reneged on my deal. My response? ""Oh,  I made a mistake when I decided to stay here at my reduced rate, but not to worry, I am sure you can find someone else  who can make it up.""

uhdan3,sysadmin,1651574720.0,"I used to work for a very large company as a dedicated SharePoint administrator. This was in the SharePoint 2007-2010 era, everything was on-premise and cloud was still a happy dream, and we still built everything on dedicated hardware in those days. My role was being the guy in charge of making sure the platform was healthy and operating smoothly for the 50.000\~75.000 users that would log in daily. I did the patching of the platform, application deployments and vetting and I was the final boss for IT tickets. Mostly back-end work, but occasionally solved front-end questions too. I was technically in charge of the (dedicated!) SharePoint service desk as well. All highly professional, maxing out most score cards in terms of compliance, processing and industry standards since part of our company did healthcare stuff and the auditors had to be kept happy.

So for those less familiar with SharePoint 2007/2010 and to set the premise on the tech we were working with, the SharePoint Web Front End servers in those days would run on Internet Information Services (IIS), there were a few dedicated SharePoint Application Servers which would run the calculating bits, and then a dedicated SQL server environment for the data. I had all this in DTAP (Development-Test-Acceptance-Production) so everything new would be thoroughly tested as SharePoint was the company's primary document repository system (having done away with network shares just after it went live, triggering a unintended mass migration of data). But the platform ran smoothly (for the end-users) and it was so well adopted in the company that everything knew their way around it or knew someone who could help, and failing that we had our dedicated service desk just for all your questions SharePoint. Life was pretty good.

We had made an intentional split between a 'vanilla' platform where people did most of the day to day document storing and sharing, and a dedicated SharePoint application hosting platform where all the custom coded applications would run. These were completely separate environments because the basic platform was business critical and we didn't want to mess with it, and the application platform was only business critical to the people who used it. (Read: not business critical). For this application platform we had a development guideline set out; what restrictions you had coding your apps, the loops code had to jump through (Development they could do on their own machines, but Test-Acceptance-Production would be deployed by me), the testing requirements and (I love myself), the sign-offs on their end that they tested everything and everything was working. Things like ""Did you test if this application works after you put 10.000 entries in it?"". A few devs disliked me for asking the questions that gave them more work, but I knew the limitations of the platform and I wasn't about to solve List View Threshold issues for them a few months later.

But then the fateful day arrived. Some group over at finance mentioned they needed a new application on SharePoint. Alright, I ask an IT Development project manager to go check out their requirements. But this PM came back saying ""They already have the entire application built. They just want us to deploy it."" I was confused. Was this some third-party app they bought? But no, after checking out what they had, it turned out they went to some company, had an app built to their specifications, completely bypassing all of IT (and our own dev group). Why? I never learned. 

But then the problems came. I dug through the code, did some pre-checks and found this app was not up to our standards. Memory leaks. Modifications to the IIS web.config file (modifying how ALL OF SHAREPOINT worked), lack of documentation, the works. Basically; some average developer off the streets who had cobbled something together level of quality. So I denied the app. Not going on my platform. Nope.

Shit hit the fan.

Turns out these geniuses had spent tens of thousands of euro-dollars on this little gem. So meetings were called. I explained to the department why their app was not up to standards and would be an active risk if deployed to the other applications already hosted on the platform. That the code would have to be modified, and this time with the IT standards kept in mind. But no, they were out of money. I told them that's not my problem. I'm not introducing an active risk into our configuration. The department head (think a manager of 50-100 people in a subgroup of a far larger finance department which numbered in the thousands of people) was furious with me for refusing to deploy. Screeched at me in meetings. Was completely infuriated when I went to her boss to explain the same thing and why it wasn't going to happen. Told me I can't do that. (I definitely can, escalation is the default practice in the company when there's a deadlock between departments).  I outwardly kept professional and inwardly fumed and kept my own bosses in the loop. It got escalated all the way to the CFO and CIO (lofty people mentioned only in legend, the people who are my boss' boss' boss' boss' boss, who managed a multi-billion company and had better things to do than worry about spare change). Pointed questions were asked by C-suite personal assistants and corporate directors why the entirety of the 5000 man IT organization had been ignored when building a custom app. (I still don't know why, so I suspect there was no reason except big dumb). And of course everyone in the end looked to me on what to do next, since I was the only person in the company who had any real technical knowledge on how to tackle a debacle like this.

And that's why for the next five years, in a quiet corner of a physical data center, a lone little server was running a single-server SharePoint farm, running just one application that saw a few dozen logins per month.

So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me ""because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can't give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon.""

There’s no apparent evidence the technician deleting more than 20 terabytes of evidence data did so maliciously or was criminally motivated, according to independent investigation.

A former Dallas IT worker fired after deleting millions of police files last year while trying to move them from online storage didn’t have enough training to do the job properly, according to an independent investigation of the incident.

Despite his job primarily being focused on working with Commvault, the software company the city contracts with for cloud storage management, the former city technician only received training on the software twice since 2018, said a report analyzing the incident released this week to city officials by law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

The technician, who isn’t named in the report, told investigators with the firm that he deleted the archive files without verifying if copies of the data existed elsewhere and “did not fully understand the implications of his actions.” The report said there’s no apparent evidence the technician deleting the files did so maliciously or was criminally motivated, but rather it was due to his “flawed” yet “sincerely-held understanding” of how the software worked.

The worker has been the only person fired related to the deletion of more than 20 terabytes or more than 8 million archive police photos, videos, audio, case notes and other items. The majority of the data involved evidence gathered by the family violence unit.

According to the report, the missing files haven’t had a significant impact on the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office to prosecute active cases. Uncertainty about what files are actually lost could slow the pace of some prosecutions and have other effects.

“While it may be unlikely that any archived data would be needed for an active case, this does not mean that the lost data did not hold potential current or future evidentiary value,” the report said. “Since family violence offenders have a high recidivism rate and often commit crimes of violence, the lost archived evidence may be useful in future cases or be needed to maintain a conviction in the appeal of a case.”
Investigation

The report comes four months after the city approved hiring Kirkland & Ellis to look into what led to the files being deleted. The review was led by former U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox, who is a partner at the firm.

She plans to discuss the findings in the report during a city council committee meeting on Tuesday. The law firm interviewed 28 people for the report, including members of the city’s IT and police departments.

The district attorney’s office on Aug. 11 issued the first public notice about the deleted files. It was also the first time several city leaders, including Mayor Eric Johnson, had heard about the problem.

The technician met with a manager for an “administrative leave interview” the day after.

The technician was given notice of a pre-termination hearing on Aug. 30 and fired on Oct. 22, according to the report. The city’s chief financial officer, Zielinski’s boss, had told council members that the technician was fired effective Aug. 27.

The law firm investigation later found that between May and August, the technician had continued to delete files, even as city officials tried to restore the other lost data.

Those more recent files were backed up, but the report noted the gravity of the worker’s actions.

“These deletions indicate that the backup technician failed to appreciate the magnitude of the incident,” the report said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/t6l48a/dallas_it_worker_erased_over_20tb_of_police_files/,"Dallas IT worker erased over 20TB of police files by accident, didn’t have enough training, report says",Blog/Article/Link,2074,487,0.97

I've always had the odd headhunter call me for mainframe work but would tell them I'm 15 years removed from that work and don't really remember it.  Mid last year I started getting more hits about it and finally responded.  The woman said there is a severe shortage of people to work on mainframes and you can almost name your price.  At first I'm thinking bullshit, you are just buttering me up for a contract that's going to pay half my asking price.

So I went to an interview and was very honest I haven't touch a 3270 terminal in 15 years.  There a few errors and commands I remembered (SB37 D U,tape,alloc etc) and that was enough for the guy to hire me... at almost 45k more than my current job.  He told me they've been running a skeleton crew for months then two of their mainframe guys both over 70 finally said no more.  They had been trying to get folks to train on it but no one wants to mess with it.

I really did hem and haw over it for a few weeks trying to decide if I wanted to do this.  Finally I decided why not.  Cobol and DB2 will still be here long after I retire.  I called him Thursday afternoon and accepted the offer then he offered me an extra 18k starting bonus if I started Monday.  Yeah it was a dick move but I called my boss and told him I wasn't coming back to work.  He understood when I told him the bonus and asked me to text him when they need a manager.

You're a tyrant to them.

&#x200B;

Am I perfect?  Absolutely not.  But I make sure my staff get the best raises I can, the best tools I can, the highest bonuses I can, most importantly, loyalty.  I can tell my staff to follow me in into a shit storm, and they will do it.

&#x200B;

Why?

&#x200B;

Because they know I have their back, and I'll jump in that shit storm with them if need be, and you should do the same for your staff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/iowwq2/kindness_goes_a_long_way/,Kindness goes a long way,General Discussion,2062,390,0.97

Edit: Just to be clear I am just expressing my opinion that those who have multiple IT job functions or all in one IT people post their IT questions/problems/solutions/rants in the right subreddit. IMO this subreddit is for sysadmin related posts. So yes, while you may fix a printer, fix the CEO's laptop, provision 12 new virtual servers and administer sharepoint your postings about the printer and laptop should go in another subreddit. Especially if they are just a rant about how dumb the user is. If you have a legitimate question or technical post about a desktop support issue I think most of us don't mind. But when it is a rant about dumb users spilling water on their laptop and how you were the only one smart enough to figure it out, that might go somewhere else.

I have nothing against people who do all in one IT. They have every right to be here and post and even the people who aren't sysadmins should be here to learn. But just because you are a sysadmin doesn't mean everything you post should be in the sysadmin subreddit. Just post in the appropriate subreddit.

When you think of archiving business data from a SaaS service, do you often think of running a local java VM to do it? No, right? Of course you don't think about that. 

No sane company on earth would just sketch out some api garbage and barf it into a compiled .jar. Right? 

A D O B E

0. Request comes in to archive data. 
1. End user contacts Adobe support in preparation> gets us docs. (Good user!)
2. Support gives directions. Multiple options, we determine the .exe on windows has the most features/audit trails so we go that path. 
3. The .exe requires Java to run. Jeez, you couldn't have written it in anything else? Fine I'll install java. The version req v5-v8 seems broad enough. 
4. Go to install Java, and it's paid-only for corporate since 2019 I learn. I don't want Oracle's lawyers coming after me so I install v7 since it's supported. 
5. The exe appears to be SMACKED DOWN by Sophos. But still runs. Modules are probably blocked. 
6. Connection lost error. If there was a connection to begin with, it couldn't have been that good, eh?
7. I go against my best instincts and disable it temporarily to try. 
8. It's able to launch without the warning but same error. 
9. I email rep again and they say ""You can use Box or Evernote"". This is terrible. I don't want my company's sensitive docs being thrown into a 3rd party I don't have any engagements with.

Seriously, ***do not*** use godaddy. I already wrote [a long comment about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gime2v/network_solutions_just_needs_to_go_away/fqhtc28/) but I want to repost it so people see it. Feel free to ask any questions :)

Here's the benefits of not using GoDaddy: 

- Pricing that isn't insane! $25/yr for .com and whois protection?!? what??? I pay less than $10/yr for this through cloudflare. A few hundred domains and this starts to add up. You can save $(X)X,000/yr by just not signing up with the literal worst offers available on the internet.

- Competent support staff members! I haven't had to contact them in years (which should really be its own bullet point), but last time I talked to them - like, on the phone, because they put the phone number in the footer of every page - namecheap had great support

- No more upsells!! One time I got a **phone call** trying to sell me on email service 🤮

- (**This is the big one**) A lack of dark patterns and flat out deception to stop you from migrating away. Godaddy will actively work against you every step of the way when you try to move away. This is not a healthy business relationship and you *will* regret signing up with godaddy when you eventually want to migrate 

Seriously, there's no reason to use godaddy, 1&1, network solutions, or anything else like that, unless you're forced to by your employer. They're all literally identical services that just forward information you tell them to the ICANN. In fact godaddy and friends are often worse because they'll wait the maximum 3 days they're allowed to before sending your information to make it harder to migrate off. Register your domain on namecheap for a year and then transfer it to cloudflare. If you don't want to use those two there's still plenty of other good options you can find in 30 seconds on google. Here's a tip though, if it costs more than $13/yr **after the first year** (shitty registrars will often sell the first year registration at a loss and then charge $20-30 every year after that) for a .com, they're relying on the fact that you don't know anything. The registrar business is insanely competitive because there's nothing anyone can offer to be better other than good support, which you won't need if their website works. If a .com costs less than $8.03, they're playing some kind of game you'll probably end up losing because that's the amount it costs them in fees to do it (not accounting for any other costs, just the fees the ICANN/verisign/etc charge).

In the end, I managed to get everything set up correctly, and I now understand how vital these mechanisms are. However, DMARC adoption is still low, and this might have something to do with the fact that there are people, like me, struggling with implementation.

I started working on a project with a friend that could probably and hopefully help people with this by visualizing the communication between servers when an email gets delivered.  

Here is what we have so far: [https://learnDMARC.com](https://learnDMARC.com)

It allows you to send an email and show you the processes that happen in the background when SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are validating. In addition, it uses the actual email, so you can also see how your email is performing at this moment.

nh8fbu,sysadmin,1621537023.0,"Y'all are going to love this one. I'm in healthcare IT. We have a hospital, multiple doctor's clinics, multiple physical therapy clinics, ER/EMS that services multiple counties, and several LTC facilities.

I get a call from our surgery department about a PC that has ""a broken network cable"". I remind them that they need to use the ticketing system so we can accurately identify and track issues internally... **you know like a physician might do...** but I'll send someone down to have a look soon (I have three meetings I have to attend.) I don't know how a network cable got cut... but maybe it was just old and the RJ-45 came loose. It can happen.

I send one of our T1's, great kid, always does anything we ask. Since it's surgery, before entering the clean room he has to put on latex gloves, a gown, booties, and a cap. I've had to do it a few times, and it can be extremely annoying and frustrating to have to do it for what can sometimes be a 30-second fix.

He politely waits about 10 minutes for one of the surgery nurses to escort him to the PC. It turns out that the affected system is the PC that we use for endoscopy and is directly connected to a recording system used during procedures.

The network cable is plugged in. The NIC light is flashing. He can connect to the outside internet, so there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.

He does notice that there is a small yellow RCA jack sitting on top of the PC... *""Hmmm that's odd. It's part of the capture card and shouldn't be here... it couldn't even get out unless someone actually opened up the PC and took it out...""*

Yea. 

It turns out that one of our genius surgeons thinks he is an IT wizard because he's set up his home wifi, has a Ring doorbell system, and a smart security system. Yes. You're totally an IT Gandalf because Best Buy walked you through it. 

He opened up the machine, fiddled around with the capture card, and broke off the RCA jack, (yes, yes it should be a modern HDMI card... but purchasing is above my paygrade and the recording system is like 11 years old from long before I got here.) Then he has a nurse call us when he realizes he has a procedure soon and he can't record.The card is literally from 2007. Luckily our VAR has a replacement that is being sent overnight.

wtfc10,sysadmin,1661023706.0,"Officially in week 2 of our first child and after waking up for the millionth time in the middle of the night, the similarities dawned on me:

- There’s a “standard” set of troubleshooting steps: diaper change, feeding, swaddling. I run though these (like my typical “restart, update, reset”) then just start trying stuff.
- There’s no documentation, only vague suggestions written down by previous generations.
- Much like calling vendors, you can call for help (pediatrician), but it’s expensive and not that useful most of the time anyway. 
- The error messages (crying) are cryptic at best, and totally useless at worst.
- Things always go wrong in the middle of the night.
- Caffeine is pretty well essential 
- If everything is working (sleeping), then don't touch anything

Obviously still some major differences, but wondering if other people have noticed the similarities, or it’s just the sleep deprivation taking.

mufo7v,sysadmin,1618882307.0,"To keep it short this client contacted us about 2 years ago after his IT support left (his IT support was a guy that owned a phone repair shop and did ""enterprise IT work"" on the side). We've had to clean up messes from this guy before (it's a small town) but this one takes the cake.

So apparently this client contacted us 2 years ago, a year before I started working here, and asked us to give his business a once over. My boss said apparently after he heard our hourly rate he wasn't interested anymore. Today we get a call saying none of the PCs on his network were able to connect to his server or load patient data. He then rebooted the server and was getting a no OS found message.

So we get there, I take a look at the server, RAID controller sees all the drives, virtual drive looks fine, BIOS/Lifecycle settings looks fine. Boot with a Windows 10 install USB and set boot files and make the partition active, reboot, and we're in Windows. After thinking my job was done I see something I never like to see on the desktop...

RECOVERY_INSTRUCTIONS.html

Fuck. Look at all his drives and all his files are encrypted. Shut his server down and tell him we need to check his PCs. Every single PC in his office is on FUCKING WINDOWS XP. Jesus Christ. 

So I boot to Linux on his server to see what's left and every damn file is compromised. Boot back into Windows because why the fuck not since everything is ready screwed, upload the ransom letter and one of the files to ranson-id, and not only is it a strain that has no recovery option but a huge banner at the top of the page that says ""ALERT: PORT 3389 IS OPEN AND MAY LEAVE YOU VULNERABLE"". Thought that maybe the attacker did this. Nope, the ""IT"" guy before put the server in the fucking DMZ and opened port 3389 and I confirmed this because the doctor said he'd sometimes remote in when they needed help.

Backups? Had some in place but it was just a .bat that ran every night to copy data to an external and it got compromised too. 

Spent the day getting him new PCs because his others were so old I couldn't even get the Windows 10 install to launch properly, upgraded his server to 2019, got his domain set back up, and his software installed. Had to explain to him that his 12 years of patient data and x-rays are gone and talk him out of paying the ransom. He's still extremely considering paying the crazy amount they are asking for.

Made him aware of how to report it to the FBI and got him in contact with the tech support for his patient software to set his database back up. Backed up his encrypted files to an external and told him to be hopeful in the future someone finds a way to decrypt it.

Users had an option to either download an app or to request a physical hardware token to authenticate themselves when logging into their windows account. After much training and 1 on 1, it seemed to be a great security solution, or so I thought. But no matter what the solution, stupidity always finds a way.

I was assisting a new user at the information desk for an unrelated issue at the time when I stumbled upon a different users credentials nicely written on a sticky note, laminated and taped down in plain sight right on the desk next to the keyboard for all users & even some customers to see. I thought ""Well, it's a good thing we have 2FA right?"" just before noticing the hardware token (one of the ones that cycles through pins) just inches away from the note.

After helping the new user, I go and confront the department manager regarding the matter. Their answer? ""Oh yeah, I just have everyone sign into that same account. Makes life *sooo much* *easier* since everyone always forgets their passwords.""

Out of curiosity, I checked to see who the new user was signing in as, and sure enough it was the stickied credentials.

So in short, we have 12 users using joe schmo as a common logon; even though they all have their own accounts & tokens, a manager that has acknowledged that the common login was being removed for a reason but is now training employees to use joe schmo's account as the new common login, and credentials as well as the OTP token in plain sight for anyone to use.

[PDQ Deploy & Inventory](https://www.pdq.com/) : Very well known, this software deploys silently softwares even in the free version. Although the paid licence is very much worth it, don't miss what the free one can do !

[Spacesniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) : TreeSize, but it's 100% free on network and much more easier to read in my opinion.

[FreeFile Sync](https://freefilesync.org/) : Synchronize data, create batch jobs locally and on networks

[Keepass](https://keepass.info/) : You password manager. Very easy to use, but also features very powerful overrides and teamwork capabilities. Create shotcuts to instantly open the right protocol / software / webpage to remotely connect anything and send your crendentials.

[Remote Desktop Manager](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager) : The free version is for solo use. Allows you to store all kinds or remote connections (RDP, web, SSH, and much more !) with credentials. The most interresting feature is the ability to store credentials in folder and to make connections inside this folder to inherit those from your folder. So when you change your password, you just update the folder's password and everything else is updated.

[Bulk rename utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) : Why aren't you using BRU to mass-rename files and folders ?!

[Belvedere](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/belvedere.html) : The free automatic file mover is to easy to use. Want to automatically sort files according to their names or types ? Don't look further.

[Advanced Port Scanner](https://www.advanced-port-scanner.com/) : Come on, if you want to do basic network troubleshooting, you need this.

[PsTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools) : A suite of very useful tools to remotely do many things. Ma favorite are PsExec and PsPing.

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) : For more advanced network troubleshooting !

[OrcaEdit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/orca-exe) : Lookup what's hiding behind thos MSI so you can silently install *anything with any parameters...*

[AutoHotKeys](https://www.autohotkey.com/) : Create simple or not so simple scripts that you can then compile. Can basically do anything between scripting to RPA (Robotic Process Automation) thanks to its ability to call complex functions. Very easy for script beginners.

Edit : I forgot to include [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), the magnificient ISO platform ! Forget about burning ISO to USB, now you just have to have a ventoy key and copy / paste your ISO onto it !

I received an email Friday from someone complaining about our security software. In the email, they said they couldn’t find a customer’s phone number because the website was blocked and that they hate our security software. They closed the email with “You need to do better.”

So, after waiting the weekend to cool down, I sent them a reply today. I gave them, and everyone CC’d on the email, a rundown of how many emails and websites our company visits per day and how many of those are malicious and blocked by our software. I also included a list of their not-blocked, personal websites, that are visited from a work computer, which is a clear violation of the terms in our handbook. I also told her that there has never been a time we didn’t unblock a work related website when requested, and that the personal Yahoo email that we refused to unblock did not count as work related. 

I closed with telling them that I don’t need to do better. They need to do a better job with Google search because someone else copied on the email found the phone number in seconds. 

I think this time, I’m seriously going to get out of IT. It broke me. The disrespect has finally broken me. I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I think 20 years is just about enough. Maybe I’ll finally be able to go home and sit at my own computer for fun again. Maybe I’ll finally be able to leave work and not bring home a problem. Maybe I’ll finally be able to have a day off without being called for work, or be able to take a vacation and actually travel somewhere.

EDIT:

Thanks for all the comments guys, both positive and negative. I wanted to add a little to this since I can't respond to everyone.

My summary up above was exaggerated for the internet. I kept it professional and non-confrontational, which is something I definitely wouldn't have been able to do had I replied Friday. I did give a summary of our web/email traffic, but there were only 4 people on the email chain, including myself and the original person that sent it. 

I didn't include a full list of their web activity, only called out their multiple visits to recipe websites (which have given us a drive-by ransomware attack in the past, before our current security suite) that we were thankfully able to recover from), and some attempted eBay and social media activities. 

Unfortunately, referring them to their manager wouldn't change anything as it's been done previously in the past. 

I did indeed end the email by telling them to learn how to properly use Google. I agree that was probably excessive, but the rest was fairly neutral. 

The user responded with ""Wow why are you taking it so personally?"" I did not respond to that one, but, maybe that can show you the type of user this is. I know it doesn't justify my actions, but I didn't fly off the handle or anything, and it's been building pressure with them for a while. 

Also, yes, I am actively pursuing something outside of IT altogether. I've been doing this professionally since I was 18 and even earlier than that as favors for people. It's time for a change. My original post above was written at the peak of my frustration, so I apologize for that. None of the situation was helped by the fact that I had asked for Friday off and was called in anyway.

Nearly 20 years down the road, all the people I worked with that were good then are all seeing real success now. None of us knew anything really, most of us only had experience building our own computers at home.

We learned together, learned to work with customers, gained experience through a lot of pain and hard times but we all grew and learned.

I feel like I constantly see LinkedIn alerts for these men and women taking major roles at big companies or lead roles at smaller organizations. I'm very happy to see them have success and I have had some level of success at my own.

I think I started at 28k working tier 1 helpdesk. Now I make decently over six figures and designing environments. 

If you're young, don't despair. So much of this industry is learning and growing and a lot of pain to get to the end goal of the higher paid jobs and better environments.

The only thing I can recommend is that you know your worth. Don't stick around at that trash MSP for 20 years, assuming nothing better is out there. Don't assume you're too dumb to be successful. Don't assume your current gig is the safe choice. 

Use your skills to get higher offers, take those offers and repeat the process. These days, most promotions come from leaving, not from being recognized internally and moving up the ladder circa the 1960s. More money and more responsibility is taken through that new offer.

The coworker was confused about the information presented and the nature of the assignment. I did my best to walk him through what he was being presented with and what I think he was supposed to do. He thanked me and said this IT stuff was hard for him to understand since he was an accountant.

&#x200B;

At the end I said ""If this was for an Information Systems major I'd say you'd have to do some serious network design and maybe even build all of this in a virtual environment complete with documentation. I'm not sure what they expect when you're taking a class like this as an elective, though.""

He then tells me he's actually taking this course as part of a Masters Degree in MIS. ""I don't want to know all of this stuff,"" he says, ""I just want to be able to manage the people who do.""

Edit: Most if you are right that a manager doesn’t have to be technical to be a good manager. My current boss is pretty good and he only knows enough to get a general understanding of situations as I explain them. I think what really bugs me about this coworker is that if he completes this coursework he’ll have a degree that implies a level of technical prowess that he isn’t even interested in actually obtaining. That after I spent time reading his assignment and giving him pointers he still didn’t know where to begin because he was taking an advanced course with not enough prerequisite knowledge.

gt384n,sysadmin,1590793088.0,"Inspired by the recent rant post about how Infrastructure as Code and programming isn't for everyone...

>Not everyone can code. Not everyone can learn how to code. Not everyone can learn how to code well enough to do IaC. Not everyone can learn how to code well enough to use Terraform.

Most Infrastructure as Code projects are pure a markup (YAML/JSON) file with maybe some shell scripting. It's hard for me to consider it programming. I would personally call it closer to configuring your infrastructure.

It's about as complicated as an Apache/Nginx configuration file, and arguably way easier to troubleshoot.

* You look at the Apache docs and configure your webserver.
* You look at the Terraform/CloudFormation docs and configure new infrastructure.

Here's a [sample](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/index.html#example-usage) of Terraform for a vSphere VM:

    resource ""vsphere_virtual_machine"" ""vm"" {
      name             = ""terraform-test""
      resource_pool_id = data.vsphere_resource_pool.pool.id
      datastore_id     = data.vsphere_datastore.datastore.id
    
      num_cpus = 2
      memory   = 1024
      guest_id = ""other3xLinux64Guest""
    
      network_interface {
        network_id = data.vsphere_network.network.id
      }
    
      disk {
        label = ""disk0""
        size  = 20
      }
    }

I mean that looks pretty close to the options you choose in the vSphere Web UI. Why is this so intimidating compared to the vSphere Web UI ( [https://i.imgur.com/AtTGQMz.png](https://i.imgur.com/AtTGQMz.png) )? Is it the scary curly braces? Maybe the equals sign is just too advanced compared to a text box.

Maybe it's not even the ""text based"" concept, but the fact you don't even really know what you're doing in the UI., but you're clicking buttons and it eventually works.

This isn't programming. You're not writing algorithms, dealing with polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, etc. Hell, there is BARELY flow control in the form of conditional resources and loops.

If you can copy/paste sample code, read the documentation, and add/remote/change fields, you can do Infrastructure as Code. You really can. And the first time it works I guarantee you'll be like ""damn, that's pretty slick"".

If you're intimidated by Git, that's fine. You don't have to do all the crazy developer processes to use infrastructure as code, but they do complement each other. Eventually you'll get tired of backing up \`my-vm.tf\` -> \`my-vm-old.tf\` -> \`my-vm-newer.tf\` -> \`my-vm-zzzzzzzzz.tf\` and you'll be like ""there has to be a better way"". Or you'll share your ""infrastructure configuration file"" with someone else and they'll make a change and you'll want to update your copy. Or you'll want to allow someone to experiment on a new feature and then look for your expert approval to make it permanent. THAT is when you should start looking at Git and read my post: [Source Control (Git) and Why You Should Absolutely Be Using It as a SysAdmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ahardz/source_control_git_and_why_you_should_absolutely/)

So stop saying you can't do this. If you've ever configured anything via a text configuration file, you can do this.

ff49nw,sysadmin,1583626719.0,"This is a story of why I love and hate working as a sys admin in ops. My company has a habit of acquiring failing companies and it is a big reason our IT setup resembles a zoo sometimes. My company brought a tool and die fabrication business out of an estate sale in the beginning of 2020. It was a family business and once the owner died his surviving family got into a nasty business fight before selling to our company. I figured there wasn't going to be a lot of due diligence in regards to IT. They did not have a full time IT team in more than a year and it showed. When they hired a new person they shared email and account access with other employees because there was no one there to create a new account.  I figured this was going to be a start from scratch situation and physically was walked through the plant for the first time on Friday. Goal was to sit down with the workers ask what software, and hardware they were going to need and give an estimate to management how much time it would take to integrate them with the rest of the company . I brought along a developer to assess how they could build out their workflows in our corporate systems think things like service now and pega. The developers already were able to log into the web apps and could see most stuff was pretty dated and was probably on out of warranty hardware.

We get there and the workers were actually very helpful, they were relived to finally have a ""tech person"" in the building again. We spend most of the day taking time to fact find with the workers. A big complaint was that gradually the services were falling apart, an internal application that handled scheduling and orders was not working pages were taking about a minute to load and it was slowing them down significantly. The developer couldn't log in and eventually realized the server wasn't responding at all and might be hanging on a reboot or shutdown. I figured I throw these people a bone and see if a physical reboot remedied the situation or at the very least I could do an initial triage for my team to look at next week since this seemed really problematic for the staff to go without this software for very long. , A worker leads me to the data center and I could see this place was going to need a lot of attention right off the bat. The room is unlocked, had very large windows old school turn operated kind, the cabling was spaghetti, there's a lot of dust in the room and on a table I can see several desktops that I suspected were repurposed as servers. The place looks exactly like what I suspect an IT setup looks like after being in bankruptcy/sale limbo for a year.

When I turned a corner to take a look at some Racks closer I almost had a heart attack. The air conditioning units were leaking onto the floor, there were large puddles of water that already had burned out a few outlets and extension cords that were scattered across the floor. In the center of the puddle is the UPS for several racks with the air conditioners grate on top of it. To add insult to injury someone tried to fix the problem by just throwing towels on the ground. I send an email to my boss and the head of development/engineering with an emergency email basically reading we have a fire hazard and a potential outage on our hands and attach the following picture.

[https://imgur.com/a/tyHn89f](https://imgur.com/a/tyHn89f)

The head of engineering who is from the Soviet Union immediately calls me and is so flustered by the situation I described it takes him ten seconds for him to realize he was trying to talk to me in Russian.  We get senior leadership on the line including the CTO and CFO. The CFO basically was like there's no way we can operate in that environment I'm not even sure that building is insured against an electrical fire. The conference call plays out like the scene from the Martian where Jeff Daniels character tells Jet Propulsion labs they have three months instead of nine to come up with a rescue mission. We told management someone working full time on this would take several weeks to scope this out and another three-four months migrating depending on the complexity.  His response was no its not, ""IT's full time job is getting us out of that data center, you have a blank check to make it happen before the beginning of April I don't care if you guys say you need clown and pirate costumes to get it done its approved.""

While I'm not happy being given the keys to a raging inferno where wild dogs and bears have been set lose I am looking forward to the challenge of getting this done. Last 48 hours have been me documenting the  physical servers and using robo copy to get a backup onto external hard drives. We paid electricians and maintenance workers to address the electric situation in the building and water damage. This is going to be an eventful next few weeks.

\###Update

Things are getting easier. We made contact with an employee who was laid off and agreed to be paid a consulting rate for two weeks to help us decommission this room. He summed up the history of the place for me in short the IT team was marred in politics and lack of resources. You had competing IT managers working against each other. One was a tyrant who wanted every decision to go through him and purposefully wanted to obscure control. The other had a chocolate eclair backbone and hired an MSP who he promptly let do whatever they want while the company was billed for support.

Shit really started to roll when the original owner died and then six months later his son in law who was the heart and soul of the place died unexpectedly as well. The company got caught in family blood feud for two years by the surviving children. The MSP went out of business and the whole IT team was either fired or left with no contingency plans.

I'll update in a few days when we are closer to migrating everything out of this room.

\###Update2

This situation has turned into a meatball I thought I had three weeks and half to get us out of this data center. With the developments with Covid-19 that time frame turned into a week. Since we became full WFH minus essential plant floor staff. Even during a crisis people still need contact lenses, prescriptions… and that means manufacturing the bottles & cases that carry them. Even though contractors were available with so much work and construction dropping off when my city issued a stay home order for nonessential business that window closed with a slam.

&#x200B;

I pulled crazy hours this week to get these people online and out of this server room. The room needs major repairs there is water damage. electrical problems, cooling problems, and no proper outlets or wiring scheme. If a city inspector or fire Marshall saw this we'd be in serious fine trouble. I live in the DC metro area and anyone that has lived there or the surrounding Virginia suburbs knows the counties and cities can be strict, harsh, and downright cruel when it comes to code violations. Try finding legal parking in DC during the work week if you don't believe me.

&#x200B;

We settled on a dirty solution improvised solutions by setting up another room in the building.  We paid a king's ransom to our telco/ISP to setup this building on short notice to our data center. I must have been on the phone for hours with vendors trying to get an idea if we could move applications offsite without affecting the workers. Thankfully most of the time the answer was yes we could without a problem but my blood was boiling and sweat was reaching a fever pitch every time we  setup an application in our data center and tested to see if there latency issues on the plant floor . I must eaten through two or three boxes of krispy kreme donuts.

&#x200B;

Stuff that couldn’t be moved offsite instead went to an improvised server closet setup with help from the telco/ISP. It was super rushed because the ISP the next day went full blown WFH and was delaying onsite work.

&#x200B;

The nonmanufacturing related applications like active directory, on premise exchange, etc…  did not prove easier to migrate. I was excited because I figured there's loads of documentation  to automate this in 2020. Not in this case because the staff had been missing an IT person for so long they had been sharing email addresses and domain accounts. You would get into situation where the email address was [kim.ji-su-young@example.com](mailto:kim.ji-su-young@example.com) and you'd expect to meet someone of Asian descent but would find out the email was used by engineer named Steve from Fort Smith Arkansas. I had to sit down with each person read through their email box, files shares, and desktop and create their profile/mailbox in our domain. It was a rush job and there was a lot of scream tests but it had to be done. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully when the crisis abates we can circle back and correct some of the jerry rigged solutions . I'm using some of my quarantine time to look at their old active directory groups and properly implement access and groups in the primary domain these people have been migrated too, since we're rushing access was not correctly setup so it will take several days to clean it up.  Lots a work ahead in the next few months to work on proper networking,  AD cleanup, and phyiscal/ application architecture.

On the one hand, yes, this needed to go, it's running ancient, unpatched software. But on the other hand, it made it 4.48 straight years of uptime with only a single drive in the RAID failing.

jtv5in,sysadmin,1605325392.0,"I was hired as a jr. sysadmin for a small hospital in the Southwest US this last summer.  I've been working my butt off for the last few months, learning systems, earning users' trust, and cleaning up messes from years of neglect and no documentation.   It's been a great learning experience for me and I really enjoy helping people.  (Though if I find the previous sysadmin or help desk person who never removed cords that were no longer being used, I'm going to dope slap them.)

However, the recent couple of weeks have been particularly hard.  Our help desk person left for another job, leaving us without someone to answer the phone or provide basic tier 1 support.  I've had to take up the slack, along with our half-day admin assistant who knows nothing about technology. This has pushed a lot of my system projects to the side and I've had to work a bit of overtime to keep the more urgent projects moving forwards.  (We also found the stack of ""backordered"" hardware orders our previous help desk person hid. I was the one volunteered to track them down and get them delivered.  Found out you can't get something delivered that hasn't been ordered yet.  Ugh.)

It doesn't help the recent COVID spike has hit our small community particularly hard, putting everyone on edge and sending droves of citizens to our doors for testing.  This has hit our infrastructure hard and sent our help desk calls through the roof.  I've spent the last 2 weeks just putting out fires and trying to keep everyone calm.   (Some of my fav moments: ""No, the big box under the ER desk that is beeping is not the server.  It's a UPS and it's beeping because it needs a new battery.  I'll be back in a few minutes with a new one."" OR ""You need to click on the ""video"" button in Zoom for your webcam to turn on."" OR the rally fun ""For the love of my sanity, PLEASE don't ever use compressed air to clean out paper jams in the printer/copier ever again!!!"")

kwymhi,sysadmin,1610599656.0,"I'm 20 years in and most of my career I've worked at medium or large finance companies.  Your run of the mill, development teams, admins, operators taking care of a servers and workstations.  Two or three datacenters, some cloud stuff and SAAS. And years of great technology ideas piled on with systems hooked together  every which way.  I thought I was pretty good at my job.

I was humbled quick.  After orientation I was put on a project involving Kubernetes being scaled at levels far beyond anything I've worked with.  Well we ran into an issue so I'm searching the docs and finally chat with someone on my team for help.  He is like ping so and so he'll figure it out.  I'm like, Does he know Kubernetes? He sends me a link where the guy was a core part of Docker and went on to help build Kubernetes and other stuff. And it like side projects for him.   It's not just Kubernetes but everything here, there seems to be developers (there a 1000s of dev) who's wrote code in every major application and worked at all the big tech giants.  Most these guys have degrees from MIT, or Berkley, or some big foreign university majoring in comsci or math or similar field.

I'm my corner of the company, devops we are always right on the edge.  New stuff coming out and we are working on deploying it the next day.  Which is a lot of fun.  But it's like this place is so far ahead of the jobs I worked at before.  Everything I did at old jobs was assigned to a project, or tracked in some ""Insert ITIL buzzword"" system.  It could take a year to upgrade a 1000 servers in two datacenters or decide on a new piece of software.  Here we are upgrading a 1000 servers a day across 100 locations, completely automated.  Old jobs, DR is a yearly event where everyone is holding their breath praying the system doesn't die when we move, and it's never a move without something missed.  Here DR is an hour exercise every month where we move the entire datacenters workload to another site.  Our measure of success is 0 lost packets and less then .1% latency.  And breaking stuff is thrown in to test the system.

Here's another good one.  There is an open source database that has a vulnerability, found by our testers. The architects called the group that maintains the software to get an idea how long it would take to fix.  3-6 months was their response.  That is not acceptable.  Three days later the devs are testing a hotfix, the following week we are deploying it.

It still blows me away how far ahead these companies are with technology.

Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn't sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)

I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said ""yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO.""

I informed him, ""if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency.""

""Well can you check the status?""

""I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed.""

He left dejected and huff, ""I don't understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons.""

I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn't our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.

Bought 3 brand new Probook 450 G3 laptops for a client, laptops keeps mysteriously and for no reason on failing, failing as in pushing the power button will not power on the laptops, replacing the chargers/batteries got us nothing. 

Those laptops were taken to the HP authorized service center, and upon inspection they concluded that they need motherboard replacement, yes, all 3 laptops failed at the same time. Of course, the authorized service center didn't have the spare parts available in stock, I had to go into 2 weeks waiting period with no laptop replacement until they managed to get the new boards. 

This goes on for FOUR TIMES (4), the laptops had their motherboard replaced for 4 times. each time forcing me to have 2 weeks waiting period. I estimate the cost of board replacement now is way more than the laptop prices. this is all done under warranty. 

Contacted HP support center, and explained that this can't keep on happening, I need a solution by replacing or refund, I just got off the phone with their representative, they basically gave me the middle finger and said I should buy the ""HP Premium Accidental Damage Protection"" to extend the warranty for another year or so. They also claimed that we're doing something wrong on the software side that keeps on frying the boards O_o? like...wtf?

Upon refusing this lame ass solution, they said that replacing/refunding at this point is no longer an option. And here I am stuck with laptops that keeps on randomly failing.

I will never again touch a piece of hardware with the HP logo on it, fook this shit!

**Edit:** Holy shit this exploded! here are some answers:  

- Laptops are bought from a local vendor, vendor said they can only keep replacing the motherboard, they're the one who recommend that I actually contact HP directly.
- My local VAR is shit, they won't left a finger if it doesn't benefit them one way or another.
- Will try the suggested ""hold the power button 90 seconds or so"" trick at the next unexpected random laptop failure cycle. I do remember doing something like that before but it didn't do anything. 
- Lots of references to Lemon laws, I will have to check if we have something similar here. 
- ProLiant is the only thing I can honestly say good about HP, rest is shit! 
- Lenovo is king specially those T series laptops, like one of the comments below ""tank"" of a laptop.

I wished them a happy holidays and good luck

Felt so good. 


Happy Holidays ya’ll!!!


Edit: Didn’t think this would blow up. So I thought I’d share some personal details with what I went through. Hope this helps even one other person who is struggling, dealing with anxiety, or needs to find happiness again. 


So the time I worked at this company, my health got really bad. I had panic attacks every time my work phone would ring after hours. I had a lot of anxiety and depression. It got to the point where I was thinking of taking my life. 

When COVID-19 hit, people were being let go, yet my IT dept was busier then ever getting staff to work remotely, suspending accounts for people who were temporarily let go, etc… We’d gone from about 20 tickets per day average to 70 tickets. 

I fought for my staff to get raises in a time were people were losing jobs. I got them each a $10k raise at the expense of not getting a raise for myself.  In fact, I took a pay cut to make this happen. I didn’t care and my staff didn’t need to know about it. I needed my staff to stay because if they quit, I wouldn’t be able to do it alone. I always did everything I could for my dept including getting them new powerful laptops, multiple screens, etc…

Anyways, towards the end of that job, company was restructuring a bit, my manager left the company, and the new guy was making unreasonable policy changes for all departments. I didn’t even have the drive to show up to the corporate office. I’d make up stories how another place was having issues just to avoid seeing the new manager and dealing with more crap. 

At that time I also got married. My wife literally saved my life. She gave me the opportunity to just quit. I gave the company 7 weeks notice to find a replacement. (I had a savings $ goal I wanted to hit before I left and I knew they wouldn’t have let me go sooner). The moment I turned in my notice, let me tell you. IT WAS LIKE 500LBS OF WEIGHT LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS. I was breathing again. My new manager was PISSED. He didn’t show it. But you can tell from his eyes. He never bothered me in that 7 weeks about the new company policy changes I had to follow. They were stupid micro managing shit anyway.  

The owner didn’t even try to negotiate with me. Didn’t offer me more money, didn’t ask why I was leaving, what he could do to get me to stay, nothing. 

Except for my first week, the company had zero ransomware attacks during my time there. Marketing dept sent out a corporate office wide email thanking me personally about the speed improvements after our network/storage upgrade I implemented. I got crickets from exec team. 

I setup new next-gen firewalls to prevent staff at remote sites from watching porn and using social media, shopping, etc… also got all our sites VPN to corporate offices so it made the jobs easier for staff to get files electronically. They used to have to mail them costing hundreds per week. 

I switched to VoIP company wide saving $33,000 per year on phone expenses. 

Every dept saw improvements and loved most of the changes I implemented to make their jobs easier. MFA had a lot of push back but most understood why it was needed and the complaints slowly faded. 

Back to my resignation….

During my 7 weeks, I closed projects, created a spreadsheet of what subscriptions we had and what they did, when to renew, and the priority of importance. I left everything for the new guy to have and help out. 

Would you believe they didn’t even post a job listing until the Friday before my last week?

I could’ve helped train the new guy for 2-3 weeks if they had immediately posted the position.

Anyways - my last day I smiled the entire hour ride home. I found a therapist, took my meds, and a few months later I was a fucking normal person again. 

It was a bit of a struggle at first because I forgot who I was. 

Anyways - after taking some time to rest, I started a business outside of IT and so far I’ve been enjoying it. No more emergency calls to deal with. I can take off when I want. 

To those who are struggling, please find a way to help yourself. I understand not everyone is fortunate enough to have a wife support you for a few months while you are literally spending your savings on starting a new venture and hoping it pays off. But please find something that works for you. 

Take the break you need. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. And if you are a manager like I was, take care of those under you. Those guys will move mountains for you if you fight for them.

So we are getting new EMV pin pads, we were shipped the devices and went for a self install. My colleague and myself plugged them into the network next to the POS stations and the vendor is doing the back end set up. She calls us and asks to test and I say ""dont you need to know what pin pad is by what workstation? I can read you off the MAC...she says ""nope they are programmed already and good to go. Um... ok? We test and obviously it does not work. I ask her ""how does this lane know to fire up this pin pad?"" She responds ""look I dont have time to explain networking. This set off a trigger in me, I just carbon copied everyone I could find in her organization ""get her out of my server now."". Someone responded that they have logged into the system a few weeks ago and pre programmed the ip addresses of each device and they should be moved to the correct workstation. Now I am even more pissed that they just picked random static ip address in my POS subnet without checking with me. Not a good start to the day.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ljlzkw/keeping\_tabs\_on\_your\_vendors\_is\_critical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ljlzkw/keeping_tabs_on_your_vendors_is_critical/)

For the first time in my career, my company dropped a client despite potential of a large contract. The main drive behind the decision could be summarized as follows

1. The client would not approve change requests to improve cyber security which was extremely concerning since they were in the medical field. For three months we saw no progress or initiative on our recommendations. The final nail was when we were told they had not  increased their minimum password complexity policy and had not started implementing two factor (google authenticator) for vpn users. Money wasn't the issue but extreme work place toxicity, we're talking, admins acting as lone tyrants who refused to work with others.  I saw levels of ticket tennis, impeding others work, and levels of gas lighting I've rarely seen elsewhere. 

2. The owners of company looked at what it would mean to just maintain this shoe string and bubble gum environment without improving it. They came to the conclusion collecting pay checks wasn't worth it. 80 percent of their time & staff would be focused  on a horrible customer when they could be making more money doing less work for more put together customers.

3. I think the owners realized the staff attrition of working in an environment was not normal. It was going to cause their to staff leave in droves. I asked off this project a few times and I know others did the same. A few people accepted other offers because they did not want to support this customer long term.

4. This customer suffered a ransomware attack that where the total recovery time was 4 months. Largely out of their own doing they allowed an active attacker to continually breach them multiple times . I can describe the first month of the recovery as a near constant state of absolute perpetual chaos before the other IT vendors causing problems were sidelined in decision making. The idea of having to support them through multiple incidents per year like this seriously made me consider looking for a new job. Our cost analysis from our CFO added an employee stress index on his power point. It was meant as joke but one of the managers joked his analysis was wrong because it wasn't nearly high enough to explain his blood pressure levels whenever the client was brought up.

Update 1: thank you for the silver and awards.
Appreciate the feedback people wrote on their own experiences. This is a common problem for people in IT for number of factors. Generally speaking it can go on for awhile because the average non tech exec or employee doesn’t see the dysfunction in an IT department until the volcano top has built up and exploded. It is important to know and recognize  you’ve entered a toxic workplace. The technical staff can either have lot of power to see what goes on or have management so change or tech adverse it borders on negligence. In both cases this can lead to abusive or destructive behavior and people need to know when to report it or drop the work and move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/mp0qzx/we_dropped_a_client_for_not_taking_cyber_security/,We dropped a client for not taking cyber security seriously,,1871,218,0.98

It may seem like their trying to lay the blame at your feet but you have to brush it off, 99% of the time their frustrated at the situation, not at you.

2. It doesn’t matter how much you test and train, people will always complain about change, software/hardware updates even if minor will have a plethora of groans and complaints follow it. 

3. Everyone you know in your personal life will see you as their personal IT guy. You can either accept it or block them out, this is the same for any similar “fixit” profession like a mechanic. 

4. Every time there is a system wide outage even if its way out of the scope of your control…prepare for the “what did you do??/change??” emails and comments.

5. IT mojo is real. IT mojo is when a user is having a problem and it “fixes itself” just by you walking into the room.

6. You are in control of Vendor relationships. In the tech world there are 5000 other vendors out there just as eager for the sale, don’t be afraid to shop around. 

7. Printers are the devil incarnate

8. A work/life balance is important. Try to find a hobby that takes you away from anything electronic, you will feel better about life if you do. 

9. You are in customer service, sometimes a user’s problem is the dumbest thing you’ve ever seen (USB unplugged, monitor not turned on) making them feel like “it could happen to anyone” instead of “what an idiot” goes a long way. Your users are your customers, treat them that way.

10. Religiously follow tech websites and read trade articles. You know that thing you’re trying to fix at work? There could be a way better way of doing it.

11. Google search is a tool, not a cop-out, don’t be afraid to use it

12. Collaboration/Networking is key, find friends who do the same thing you do and lean on them, but make sure you are there for them to lean on you too. They will prove invaluable

13. You are the easiest person to throw under the bus when something goes wrong for one of your users… “Yeah I tried sending that email to you last night boss but my email wasn’t working!” “I know I said Id have that PDF to you earlier today, but my adobes broke and no one fixed it yet”

14. (Goes along with 13) Your users will more than likely not tell you something isn’t working until the last minute…then will expect you to backburner whatever you are working on to fix their problem.

15. Just because YOU can drag and drop, never expect that EVERYONE can drag and drop

16. It’s best if you reply to “What happened?” questions after outages with as short as answer as possible. Noone knows/cares about MX, SPF, and DKIM records and how they affect your Exchange server. A simple… “email stopped working, but I fixed it” will suffice 

17. Make backups, make backups of backups, restore/check backups often

18. Document EVERYTHING even if its menial. You will kick yourself for that one thing you did that one time that…I cant….cant remember what I did…it’ll come to me just hold on. 

19. You are a super important person that no one cares about until something goes wrong.

Before this, the biggest company I worked for had about 40 laptops, a couple of servers, and everything on a shoestring budget.

Anyway, on my weekend on-call assignment, I got a page for a database acting funny.  After getting the impact mitigated we started searching for the root cause since this is now our backup cluster it needs to be available.  I also had to escalate since this was way past my skills, but after a few hours and almost 30 senior system admins and senior developers, we (they at this point I'm just listening) found a bug.  We could reproduce this bug and found this bug could cause the failure to happen in the live system with the same conditions.  In a nutshell, a couple of queries happing a certain way could lock the table, and some other stuff I didn't get.

They, he and the vendor, went back and forth until one of our executive vice presidents joined the call.  I had to look the VP up and found he is 7 levels above me!  He gets the information and tells us to hang on while he calls their CIO.  I have to message someone to ask if he can do that cause to me that wouldn't even enter my mind.  He replied, Of course, we are about 70% of their business. Besides most of those executives have worked together at other companies.  

He was right, it wasn't 20 minutes later and their main developers were on the call and within 2 hours there was a tested fix pushed out.

I went over all the basics, the types, what to watch out for, and why/how practicing basic security can prevent most of these problems.

I scared the ever living shit out of them. So much so, operations is already putting together rules and training for every hourly employee. Support people are asking for one-on-ones with me on how to practice better security.

ukl31l,sysadmin,1651953532.0,"Some of the details have been made vague on purpose.

A little while ago, after months of troubleshooting developer systems, we have found evidence that a majority of systems on our networks were running things like Cudo Miner and related cryptomining software. We are fairly certain that it was a former administrator that we let go late last year, because we found a variety of audit trails and evidence (like GPO, some puppet manifests, and so on) that point directly back to him. He was a ""legacy employee"" who was stubborn, difficult, and a suspicious person in general. He had started with the company in the early 2000s, as a friend of a former company owner who sold his portion during a buyout a few years ago. That's all I feel comfortable saying about him. He had access to the keys to the kingdom for almost 20 years, and making sure his access was removed took several months of preparation, two days of audits, and constant vigilance (SIEM, firewall, logging, audits, permissions, and so on). To the best of my knowledge, no attempt to access our systems have been made since he was separated.

So far, we discovered a majority of the company desktops, bare metal servers, and cloud servers had some form of cryptomining running, and was intentionally hidden under various renamed service accounts. In addition, we found some ""hidden accounts"" on some of our cloud systems representing tens of thousands of dollars a month of machines whose only purpose we have discovered so far is for cryptomining. We're pretty sure it was him because of how the billing for these systems were hidden ""under the radar"" via accounts that only an internal employee would have known.  I have no idea how long he was doing this, but I can speak for at least a few years ago, possibly longer before that.  I don't know, and probably have no way of knowing, how much bitcoin (or whatever) he mined, and/or how much he made. I did provide the company president with some details and figures how much it COST (at least in cloud instances) per month, and suffice to say, our 2022 goal of ""reducing overhead cost"" will be made by shutting down these cloud systems alone. 

We do not think it was malware, but we are checking for malware constantly, and now specifically for this type of behavior. The reason these didn't show up in previous scans was part of some legacy process I won't go into, but it was ""hidden in plain sight"" with some clever tricks. Any and all references to cryptomining, bitcoin, and the names of the software on these desktops were changed to parts of the legacy process. One of our cloud providers had restricted our accounts for suspicions of running crytpominers, and repeatedly warned us of this restriction vuia email, but there was a mail firewall rule that deleted these, plus any and all references to cryptomining or bitcoins, as spam. 

We ""nuked from orbit"" all the laptops and desktops, shut down all the useless cloud systems, and did a full audit of all our software, services, GPOs, and manifests. As far as we know, there was no ""auto-repair"" feature, as when we wipe a system of a cryptominer, it does not re-install itself. All configurations to set these up seem to have been done manually from previous legacy employee from a git repository that we do not have access to. 

The CTO and president have contacted legal, but legal is not really technically up to speed. They are not sure that an actual crime occurred and our employee agreement does not cover anything like this. I tried to explain ""it's like he bought a fleet of vehicles with the company card, used them to run his own delivery service, and pocketed the money he made and passed the costs of running the business to along to us.""  But they respond back with how we can prove what the costs actually are and how we know it's him. I have shown them the proof we had it's him, but I suspect that nothing will be done, and possibly would not stand up in court anyway. I have just tried to be happy that I saved the company a lot of money, and now the developers are thrilled I have made their systems ""turbo-fast!""

This is out of my hands, really, except ensuring this doesn't happen again.

the start of the new fiscal year for the US Air Force.  We're moving to
**The Cloud**, so our on-prem Unix boxes are going away.

This didn't come out of the blue (no pun intended), but it wasn't fun.
I can't complain; how many of you have ever gotten a few month's warning
saying ""this is likely to happen"" followed by two week's warning that
it's a done deal?

I joined the AF in 1981, and probably would have stayed in for a few tours
if they didn't want me to babysit missiles in Minot, ND.  I'd rather dive
face-first into my cat's litterbox, so I became a contractor and joined
the C-17 Program Office (Wright-Patt AFB) in 1988, three years before
the C-17 had its first flight.  The place has been renamed a few times,
but I've been there ever since.  Yes, you actually can change employers

### Odd high-points

* We had a computer room with 4800-baud modems for talking to the IBM PROFS
system at Douglas Aircraft (-> McDonnell-Douglas -> Boeing).  Our first
communications involved software that resembled a psychotic version of
**Expect** which was used to screen-scrape the PROFS system for things
like email.  Sucked beyond the ability of technology to measure.

* I remember installing our first 2.2-Gb disk drive in a Pyramid Unix box.
The damn thing weighed around 120 lbs and needed two of us to wrestle it
into place.

* We did backups on 9-track tape, just like the spinny things you see in
some of the first James Bond movies.

* We had users connecting to a Unix box via a menu system (way before 486
systems were available to run MS) so I wrote curses programs to schedule
temporary-duty postings, assemble and print reports written in TROFF, etc.
Fun times.

* We downloaded /etc/hosts from Stanford Research about once a month and
had to rebuild the DBM file before we could send mail or connect outside.

* I still have a copy of the email that was sent locally after the
Morris Worm hammered a few of the base network systems.  It's a real
are-you-shitting-me moment to see a message that starts with ""The Internet
is under attack"".

* I remember coming on base after Reagan hit Libya and seeing smoke coming
out of a window.  Apparently someone showed their disapproval by setting
a fire.

* I had to stay home for three days after 9/11, and when I was allowed
back in, it was normal to have the underside of my car checked regularly.

* I wrote something that would log the CPU temperature on our Solaris V890,
check for spikes, and send me an IM because it meant the A/C failed but
everything else was still running.  This led to several 4am trips to work,
but we didn't lose a room full of hardware to heat.  A similar program
looked for gaps in ping answers to warn me about power outages.

### What's next

I do support on call every 4 - 5 months to do simple configuration changes on the server.

I politely apologize and say he better find a dev guy to try and help him with the services, as I can help maintain the infrastructure but not the code or the app, he goes his way and calls a couple of days letter asking for help, I repeat the same response and he disappears for a few more days.

I find the first error in the event log that is related to MSMQ, Google it, come up with a solution and apply it, services are magically up and running again, it was something related to truncating the MSMQ log files and resetting a registry key.

I log into the teams meeting and there is my old boss whom I’ve known for about 18 years looking ghost white with blood shot eyes. He’s been a mentor to me for many years at times more like a brother than a boss. We have been through thick and thin and both survived numerous layoffs. He had to break the news that my company was letting go a large number of people across the board to reduce cost in light of inflation, rising material costs, supply chain issues, etc. My last day will be December 31st. 

Honestly I feel bad for him for having to do that to someone you’ve worked with for so long.  Later I was told that the victims were picked by upper management and my boss and his had no say so in the matter. Upper management didn’t take anything into account other than the numbers. Not performance, past achievements, or criticality of role. We were just numbers. 

HR explained the severance package and benefits which are pretty good considering. Two weeks per year x 18 years adds up but still I am heart broken and nervous for the future. Finding a new job in a recession isn’t going to be easy and I’ve not really had to job hunt for 18 years though I have tested the waters a time or two over the years. I slept like shit last night laying awake for hours in the middle of the night worrying about the future. I am the sole bread winner for my family. 

I guess this post is more for me to vent than anything else but I’d be happy to hear any advise. I made some phone calls to friends in other shops as well as some close contacts with vendors to let them know I’m looking. 

Any tips for getting out there and finding a job? What are the go to IT job sites these days? Are recruiters a good avenue? I’m completely out of the loop on job hunting so any guidance would be appreciated. 

TLDR; Will be unemployed come January 1st from long time job. Very sad and anxious about the future. What now?

Update: Wow, I tried to pop in and check the responses around lunchtime and was blown away by all the positivity! This community is awesome. 

After really digging into the severance reference materials I feel better about the situation. It seems taking some time to decompress before I go hard looking for another gig is the thing to do. Maybe I’ll take that time to train up for a triathlon to keep myself busy.

9en36n,sysadmin,1536585694.0,"Good Morning All,

I'll try to keep this post brief as the point is simple.


When I started my career in IT, I was completely lost.  I had drive though... and fortunately had a mentor who was willing to guide me through any hurdles I came to.  He was somebody that when I needed help, I could go to and talk about complex troubleshooting issues, end user struggles, and even personal struggles that had nothing to do with work.  He was somebody that I came to rely on for guiding myself through the early years of a new field of work.


It wasn't until I came to work one morning and he wasn't there that I realized he had struggled with his own mental health for years battling depression.  The night before, he intentionally overdosed in an effort to end his mental pain.  While I tried to be there for him the way he was for me, there was some other aspect of his life that he needed to talk through and figure out.


Today is National Suicide Prevention Day and while sometimes these days of importance seem ridiculous, this one strikes close to me.


If you are struggling through depression or need to talk to somebody, find the help.  If you notice somebody who is struggling, ask them if you can help.  The world really is a better place with you figuring out why it was DNS.

g6d5wx,sysadmin,1587602847.0,"Environmental variables [have been around since DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#DOS). They can make your (and my) life easier.

Not every system uses C as the main drive.  Some enterprises use folder redirection, and relocates the Documents folder.  *Some places in the world don't speak English and their directories reflect that.* Use those environmental variables to make your programs ""just work"".

* `%SystemDrive%` is the drive where `%SystemRoot%` is located. You most likely don't need to actually know this
* `%SystemRoot%` is where the Windows directory is located.  You hopefully don't care about this.  Leave the Windows directory alone.
* `%ProgramFiles%` is where you should place your program files, preferable in a Company\\Program structure
* `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` is where you should place your 32-bit program files. Please update them for 64-bit.  32-bit will eventually be unsupported, and business will be waiting for you to get your shit together for far longer than necessary
* `%ProgramData%` is where you should store data that isn't user specific~~, but still needs to be written to by users~~ (Users don't have write access to this folder either).  Your program shouldn't require administrator rights to run as you shouldn't have us writing to the `%ProgramFiles%` directory.  Also, don't throw executables in here.
* `%Temp%` is where you can process temporary data.  Place that data within a unique folder name (maybe a generated GUID perhaps) so you don't cause an incompatibility with another program.  Windows will even do the cleanup for you.  Don't put temporary data in in `%ProgramData%` or `%ProgramFiles%`.
* `%AppData%` is where you can save the user running your program settings.  This is a fantastic location that can by synced with a server and used to quickly and easily migrate a user to a new machine and keep all of their program settings.  Don't put giant or ephemeral files here.  You could be the cause of a very slow login if you put the wrong stuff here and a machine needs to sync it up. *DON'T PUT YOUR PROGRAM FILES HERE. The business decides what software is allowed to run, not you and a bunch of users who may not know how their company's environment is set up.*
* `%LocalAppData%` is where you can put bigger files that are specific to a user and computer.  You don't need to sync up a thumbnail cache.  They won't be transferred when a user migrates to a new machine, or logs into a new VDI station, or terminal server. *DON'T PUT YOUR PROGRAM FILES HERE EITHER.*

You can get these through [API calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/known-folders) as well if you don't/can't use environmental variables.

Use the [Windows Event Log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging) for logging.  It'll handle the rotation for you and a sysadmin can forward those logs or do whatever they need to.  You can even make your own little area just for your program.

Use [documented Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes) when exiting your program.

Distribute your program in MSI (or now [probably MSIX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview)).  It is the standard for Windows installation files (even though Microsoft sometimes doesn't use it themselves).

[Sign your installation file and executables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/how-to-sign-a-package-using-signtool). *It's how we know it's valid and can whitelist in AppLocker or other policies.*

Edit: some more since I've had another drink

Want to have your application update for you? That can be fine if the business is okay with it. You can create a scheduled task or service that runs elevated to allow for this without granting the user admin rights. I like the way Chrome *Enterprise* does it: gives a GPO to set update settings, the max version it will update to (say 81.\* to allow all minor updates automatically and major versions are manual), and a service. *They also have a GPO to prevent user-based installs.*

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) (should go in the version property in the installer file and in the Add/Remove Programs list, not in the application title) and have a [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). You can also have your installer download at a predictable location to allow for automation. A published update path is nice too.

ADMX templates are dope.

USB license dongles are a sin. Use a regular software or network license. I'm sure there are off the shelf ones so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Don't use that damn custom IPv4 input field. Use FDQNs. IPv6 had been around since 1998 and will work with your software if you just give it a chance.

The Windows Firewall (can't really say much about third party ones) is going to stay on. Know the difference between an incoming and outgoing rule. Most likely, your server will need incoming. Most likely, you clients won't even need an outgoing. Set those up at install time, not launch time. Use Firewall Groups so it's easy to filter. Don't use Any rules if you can help it. The goal isn't to make it work, it's to make it work securely. If you don't use version numbers in your install path, you might not even have to remake those rules after every upgrade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/g6d5wx/developers_you_can_make_sysadmins_happier/,"Developers, you can make sysadmins happier",Rant,1795,562,0.97

(edit: I would hate to think people are leaving their job or company because it is too stressful or their work-life balance is whacked.  You are far more valuable to your family, friends, and community than you are to your company.  Before you quit or die due to how people treat you - change your situation or get fired but never give up.)

Very rarely did i hate going to work. Twenty years in IT and only nine months were torture. 

I've had low pay and crappy bosses for half of my career. 

Here's what I learned that has taken all the pressure off me. 

* Every server can crash, the backups could fail, the data could be irrecoverable, the company could fold and I'd still would have my skills, health, and realistically be able to get a job making at least half in less than a month. 

* My boss may hate me, my coworkers may not respect me, and the hot receptionist might be laughing with my ex girlfriend about me but as long as the checks keep cashing there's little reason to stress. 

* Unrealistic deadlines, when made known they are unrealistic, go unmet, are simply wishes not granted by the management genie. 

* Security is my responsibly when I have authority. If management says certificates are expensive and should not be implemented, despite my warning, then I have faithfully executed my responsibility. 

* Errors, mistakes, and oversights happen. We're all human. Repeated mistakes are my problem. A disproportionate response for an unknown outcome or a typo on the first offense is evidence of an unstable personality. 

* To start my day off right, everyday when I walk into my office I think I am blessed. I have a job, I can support my family, and today I can be a positive part of someone's day.

* All my documentation, code, and instructions are written in a way I don't have to answer questions.  

* Trust no one with gossip and anything spoken or written about my boss or coworker or clients will come out at some point. 

* Friendships in the office and verbal agreements vanish the moment job security or ego is threatened.

* Always be an asset to the company. Liabilities get offloaded.

* You'll always been seen by others and treated as the role you were first hired for.

I've been a sysadmin for over 15 years. I'm at a senior level, with primary responsibilities like Windows/AD, cloud platforms, virtualization. Secondary responsibilities include server hardware, storage, load balancers, firewalls, network as needed.

I may do 1 or 2 hours of legitimate work any given day. My primary areas of responsibility run pretty smoothly, so I rarely have fires to put out (once every 3-4 months). Though when they do occur I am responsive and get things fixed quickly. 

Other than that, I literally spend 90% of my work day surfing the internet or watching Netflix. I did this in the office, and working remote has only led me to start playing video games during the day as well. 

I know this speaks poorly of my work ethic, and of management oversight. But I have been like this my entire career at the 4 or 5 jobs I've had. They've ranged from 500-15000 employees. I under promise and over deliver. System needs an upgrade? I'll tell you it'll take 3 weeks...finish in 2...and actually spend maybe 1 week doing it (if that).

gxq3x6,sysadmin,1591446571.0,"I saw a thread which prompted a memory of something I did a long time ago. It was a situation where I did something wrong, but which I don't regret at all. This made me think, who else has a 'No Regrets Guilty Confession' they'd like to share? Please no judgement in this thread, just some fun telling stories of things we'll (hopefully) never do again.

So my story. TL;DR at the end.

Many years ago, I was working at a place as the IT Manager with technical skills, with 1500+ users. Both internet access and remote access was crucial to the business running. I ran a team of half a dozen top people, who loved their jobs and wanted nothing more than to do their best with what they had, and support their colleagues to use their IT resources. They were proud of their work, and their outcomes.

When I started there, however, I found that they had a synchronous 1Gbps internet connection, but it ran through an old bare metal Windows 2000 Server. This server was acting as proxy, filter, reverse proxy for hosting (and we hosted EVERYTHING onsite), incoming VPN, the whole shebang. On a good day, we'd see 100 Mbps through it, on a normal day maybe 50 to 75 Mbps, and on a bad day maybe 30 to 40 Mbps. To make matters worse, this was years after Win 2k was EOL & EOS, the filtering system was also EOL with the company not even existing anymore so EOS as well, and the only redundancy was RAID5 and dual power supplies. No other hardware redundancy/HA, no software redundancy/HA, and only the one internet connection. Also no backups to boot (I fixed that one pretty quick). There were scheduled scripts galore to keep it running which had to be checked every day because scheduled tasks would randomly fail as well - things like manually cleaning out tmp directories, restarting a couple services because if they ran longer than 36 hours they would fail, real fun stuff.

So as soon as I found all this out, I was jumping up and down about it, and the whole IT team got on board doing the same, wanting it replaced - they'd wanted to for years, but hadn't had an IT Manager who had the balls to push. The higher ups wouldn't budge. We explained many times the risk involved to the business, how it could take a long time to get up and running again, how silly it is to have a 1 Gbps line and a server that can't handle it, etc, but no go.

A few months into my job, we had a BSOD on the server and upon reboot, it wouldn't boot - we never found out why, but on the third attempt it was ok again. Luckily, this helped the higher ups realise that there was indeed a problem needing fixing (the outage time cost them quite a bit of money), except for the big boss (equivalent of CEO) who had a stick so far up his arse he could taste it. After lots of negotiation, we finally convinced him to allow us to look into replacement options, with him regularly reminding us that he was doing it to shut us up and ""keep the rabble happy"", and for no other reason.

Several weeks later, we've had three companies come in and spec up solutions, chose the one we thought was the most reasonable (2 x Palo Alto and addition of a secondary backup internet connection), and then had a few weeks fight with the big boss and some other higher ups about the cost of it all (admittedly, it was the most expensive solution). The company who were offering the solution were absolutely amazing and put in a huge amount of time and effort helping us get it over the line with the powers that be, including meetings, presentations, extra phone calls one by one with all the higher ups - they were just amazing.

So we purchase these Palo's, get the second line in, set it all up alongside the old server, and overnight perform a go-live. It all goes amazing, no issues, as well oiled as a priests willy. Our rollback plan was to turn off the new, turn on the old, and back to norm - but we never had to use it.

The next morning, the whole IT team along with the senior engineer on the project from the company helping us is in early to help support people with the new VPN software, any internet issues, etc - but the only support needed in the end was helping people get used to using the new VPN software. Then a call comes in. It's an L1 tech who's working with the big boss. He's lost his shit big time. He hates that he needs to use a VPN software, and liked his old Windows VPN, and doesn't like it, it's all crap, etc. etc. and then comes the demand - turn it all off, turn on the old server, and return the hardware, get a refund, not pay the company any more, he's humoured the IT team long enough, it's done. There's not enough begging and pleading to change his mind. You could kidnap his daughter for blackmail and he'd sacrifice her. I had to relent and agree to the rollback, on threat of my job, thinking I'd just convince him otherwise later.

I saw red. The whole IT team saw red. The despair I saw in the eyes of the engineer from the company doing this was something I'll never forget. I was utterly furious, and was almost ready to quit, but couldn't do that to my amazing team.

After some discussion about ways we could change his mind, I said we had no choice and had to do what he asked. One of the guys volunteered to go in and perform the rollback (pretty simple), but I opted to go in and the engineer from the company followed me.

Then I had an idea.

As we're standing in front of the rack, looking at this old DL380 G2, I power off the two Palo's. I then looked at the engineer with me, looked at the DL380, and popped a couple of drives slightly out. I looked at the engineer and he just smiled at me. I knew he was on board. So I pulled out the two disks, swapped them around, and put them in. Hit the power button.

* Me: ""Huh, strange, the server won't boot. Any ideas?""
* Him: ""No idea. I'm not surprised, though, given it's age.""

So we powered on the Palo's, walked out, and told the big boss that the server had completely failed, with the backing of the engineer from the company who installed the Palo's.

And that's how I got my old work a new gateway.

TL;DR - During replacement of a horrifyingly old and dangerous gateway, we were ordered to rollback for an utterly bullshit reason. I switched two hard drives around in a RAID to make it fail so we couldn't roll back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gxq3x6/story_time_confess_your_sins_what_did_you_do_at/,"Story time - Confess your sins.

I do realize that there are a lot of scanners out there. So I will be brief and explain the core value of this scanner.

1. Scans Multiple computers remotely
2. Uses remote systems resources to make scanning fast
3. Does not hash the jar as it could be nested or edited
4. Identifies the following vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105
5. Searches all drives on system excluding mapped drives
6. Creates CSV list of affected files and locations
7. Creates JSON file with all information including errors like access issues to folders (so you know spots that might have been missed)
8. Scans JAR, WAR, EAR, JPI, HPI
9. Checks nested files
10. Does not unzip files, just loads them into memory and checks them making the scanner fast and accurate
11. Identifies through pom.properties version number and if JNDI Class is present.


[https://github.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock](https://github.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock)

# Comments
I decided to write this because I have noticed a lot of other scanners did not consider some important points that would let some of these vulnerable files through the cracks. Like:
1. Scanner for files with Log4j in it instead of the JNDI Class
2. Only scanning for JAR files
3. Scanning for hashed jar files which doesn't account for nested files.

# Instructions:

1. Download the ps1 file 
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maelstromage/Log4jSherlock/main/Log4Sherlock.ps1

jexm8p,sysadmin,1603224822.0,"I started at a company in 2017--I wasn't paid great, but a wasn't paid poorly (or so I thought). 

Office policies made it so that every little expense had to be fully justified and we were expected to save every cent we could, even if it increased operational costs later (we would buy \~6-year-old computers for \~$250 that we were constantly repairing, rather than brand-new units for $500-600.)

I wasn't mistreated by any means and the company did well while I was there--grew from 200 to 300 employees and increased gross revenue by \~60%--but when the opportunity for my current job came up, I took it without hesitation.

I've been with this new company for a year now. Not saying that I have an unlimited budget, but if there's a business need, we spend the appropriate amount of money. When a computer needs to be replaced, we replace it with a new, adequate computer (not over-speced, but not under, either). When I needed server replacements, I had to prepare a 1-sheet summary of what the costs and benefits would be.

I just had my first annual review. I was evaluated well, got meaningful feedback and reasonable goals for 2021. Including a road map to a management position next year (I acknowledge that I'm not yet ready to be a manager).

I will be getting a raise effective next week which puts me at DOUBLE my pay rate from 3 years ago. I've also been given a virtually unlimited budget for training/education in 2021.

All I can say is that it feels amazing to have a boss that values my abilities and what I can do for the company, that actually fights for me and looks out not only for the best interests of the company, but also for my best interests.

I really feel like I found a unicorn of an employer.

I was told the last review was a culture fit so I figured I must have scored some major points. A week goes by  and I hear nothing from the company recruiter or the hiring manager. I decide to reach out to both of them thanking them again for the opportunity and asking for an update on the process. A few hours later the recruiter calls me to say they've decided to move forward with other candidates. Frustrated by their poor communication and delayed process I politely asked to be removed from all further opportunities and the company recruiter said no problem.

Flash forward to at a week and a half ago, the recruiter from the company reaches out to me while out of town stating there were some changes and wanted to know if I would still be open to discussion. I agreed to chat. Last Monday I met with the hiring manager and found out the other person backed out. We talked about the position and I explained my frustration from the previous time and the manager apologized. He told me to take a couple days to think about it and we could reconnect. I was very blunt and asked how many other candidates they had this time and he said he only had the recruiter reach out to me that there are no other steps in the process but they want someone who wants to work there. He gave me his personal cell and told me to reach out with any questions prior to our follow-up (which I did a few times and he was quick to respond). He also said that the only other step left would be the discussion I have with the recruiter about the offer package.

We reconnect on Thursday do confirm my interest in the role and get any questions out of the way. He even asked personal questions to get to know me as a person. He then ended the call saying he would be chatting with the recruiter and they would be in touch. Yesterday the recruiter calls me to say they've decided to move forward with other candidates. In total shock I told the recruiter I was shocked and explained the conversation I had with the hiring manager and all he had to say was ""I don know what you and he discussed, I'm just the messenger"".

Is this seriously how companies behave when recruiting people? I have never in my 20 years of being an IT professional ever had an interview go down like this. What is wrong with people? Needless to say I will never deal with them again.

P.S. the recruiter works directly for the company I was interviewing with.

Call me crazy, but the industry is moving faster and faster into the sun with containers, immutable infrastructure, and software-oriented infrastructure management practices such as ""DevOps"" or ""Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)"". If you are still back in the stone age plunking away with VBS, batch scripting, and GUI-tool quasi-automation (\*cough\* autohotkey \*cough\*), then I would like to take the opportunity to warn you that the longer you put off learning a real automation language for Windows like PowerShell, the more it will hurt when you realize old fashioned hand built service development isn't sustainable and you try to make the jump ~~off a cliff.~~

&#x200B;

Don't let the change happen when your non-technical manager railroads you into a meeting with a smorgasbord of buzzwords and a pocketful of bad plans. Be proactive and learn yourself some PowerShell. While you're at it, get familiar with linux because a lot of your tooling is going to live on it. Each month you procrastinate, the gap between how you run things now and how the industry runs things grows wider.

4) Learn the Linux/Windows file system well

5) how to talk to people. People will literally higher someone who is less qualified because they think they’ll be easier to work with.

13sgx4o,sysadmin,1685116497.0,"Warning: long post, TL;DR below

Never say never - especially to the management!

So in Q1 this stupid OKR was set to ""reduce running costs by 10% by the end of the year"" by a management who doesn’t have any idea how things work in IT. They complain that we have too many subscriptions, claiming that surely there are a few that aren't essential, without even knowing which tool does what. At the end of the day, it's more about workplace politics than facing the reality so we had to keep that OKR and ""see what we can do."" (rolling\_eyes)

I started thinking (googling) about my options to achieve more process efficiency and cost optimization. After searching through blogs, subreddits and lots of clickbait, I came across [an article](https://www.docupike.com/cloud-based-it-documentation-tool) about using the right tools correctly to improve your processes. It was a complete sales pitch, but it still made some very valid points about saving time and money in IT and processes. In summary, it basically says this: you can get real insights on your costs and increase efficiency only if you are using the right tools for your needs and if you are using them right. That sounded fair and catchy enough so I started following the steps it pointed out. And here are what I did:

The first thing I checked was if we were in control of the data. I asked the finance team if they had some kind of IT inventory for all of our software and SaaS services that we use across all teams. It turns out it was just a mess of outdated Excel sheets, emails, and invoices from vendors here and there. I actually wondered how we survived until now in all this chaos. As this perfect chaos triggered my OCD, I took the time to sort out everything, and that was probably the most time-consuming and dreadful task I’ve done in a long time. In the end my goals were to:

a) gather information on all the tools/services we use, and

b) map each tool according to their purpose and its user groups, and

c) attaching additional information like running costs, importance or the people responsible for it.

The other challenge was to find a tool that fitted my needs which wasn’t Excel and wasn't a full-blown software asset management tool, because those “all-in-one” solutions are way too expensive and have too many fancy features that we actually don’t use or need.

Once I was done with the work, I was able to analyze our situation. And here are the amazing highlights of the day::

1. I found out that one of the software we were still paying for was completely obsolete and had been replaced by an extension of an enterprise service. No one had ever thought of letting us know. Mindblown..
2. I was able to reduce the number of licenses for three (!) different SaaS services as I learned we were paying for the ghosts of long-gone employees and no team was bothered to continue seeing their inactive accounts. An “Offboarding 101” workshop for the teams is on the way.
3. I realized we were paying thousands of bucks for an all-in-one productivity tool and people were actually using only one or two of those tens of fancy functions. Instead, it seems they simply used free online tools. In other words, adoption ratio was quite low.

That impossible yearly OKR? With these optimisations already achieved in Q2. You think you are in control of your assets and processes and one simple sales pitch article proves you wrong. Lessons learned. It was incredible to see I had no idea how much optimisation potential our processes had. And I am already working on next steps: Now although everything is optimized and all our data is tidied and organized, I still feel I can find some alternative ways to document, track and keep this data up to date all the time. For one, I’m planning to invest some time to collect software usage data automatically via API scripts to document the effectiveness / ROI of the software we are using.

Sorry for the long post but I thought maybe some of you here could also benefit from what I learned. Here is a TL;DR for my fellow admins with ADHD:

**TL;DR:** Management wanted to cut running costs by 10%, told them impossible. Found some very basic but effective tips to get a central overview of all tools, their costs and usage and was mindblown to see how much money we were burning for nothing.

* You don't have to monitor the utilization on a goat.

* Milk a goat and the goat stays milked for a while.

* There are no 32-bit goats.

* You don't have to do a demo on a goat. And if you ever do, the goat will do what it's supposed to do and there's not a lot that can keep it from doing it. 

* When a goat goes ""down"", you just bury it and buy a new goat.

* Left alone, Billy goats and Nanny goats do what they're supposed to  do. You don't need to format them, monitor them, be on-call for  them, step, trace or inspect registers. 

* Nobody cares if you're not a Certified Goat Engineer yet.

* Kill a goat to make a goat steak, and the goat stays dead.

* Most people will take advice from a goat farmer on how to paint a  fence, cook a steak, fix a tractor, etc. but most people somehow just don't want to hear it from a computer weenie. 

* Nobody can lie in a job interview about their goat experience.

* Goats don't page you.

* When it comes to ""software"" (food), EVERYTHING is compatible with a goat. 

* You don't need to buy a ""goat 98"" to fix all the bugs in your  goat 95 

* You can tell whether a goat has been ""debugged"" by looking at it.

* Goats don't become obsolete. If they do, as long as you didn't neuter  them, they make the necessary upgrades themselves. 

* No commute.

* Goats are kind of cute. Computers aren't cute unless they're  Macintoshes, and those are just plain annoying. 

* No dress code. Of any kind. EVER.

* You always have the right ""file permissions"" to milk a goat.

* If a goat gives too many timeout errors, or does not avail you  resources for your session, or if performance is generally slow for your applications on your goat, it just means you're having goat steak for dinner. 

* You don't need to visit ""shareware dot com"" to get some tools to  milk a goat. You either have your bucket or you don't. 

* The bucket leaks, or it doesn't. You do not need to ask a network if you're still the owner of the bucket. You do not need to run a  bucket compare against a copy you made of the bucket previously You couldn't care less about the checksum of the bucket. 

* You don't need to ""free up some megs"" before you milk a goat.

* You get callouses on your hands - the way God intended!

* You don't need to call a staff meeting to make sure everyone's milking goats the same way. 

* Nanny goats, with no TCP/IP stack loaded, and no DLC, still give  milk. 

* Just about any barnyard animal is fault tolerant (except some cows).

* You don't need to sign in with the front desk if you need to milk a goat on a weekend. You don't need to use a badge to open a front  gate. If you find an empty coffee pot burning on the machine on a  Saturday, you just yell at your wife. 

* You don't need to worry if you've been spending a lot of time  milking what you will later find out to have been an improperly labelled ""development goat"". 

* There is no such thing as a ""preferred goat,"" and your ""goat  context"" is always correct. Passwords do not exist and your  milking/slaughtering account will never be disabled because of  intruder detection. 

* Carpal tunnel is guaranteed. Don't worry about it.

* A goat has all the ""patches"" it will ever need. If it doesn't it just means you're having goat steak for dinner. 

* Goats that become full do an automatic ""core dump"" but they take  care of getting themselves reset and on-line. You just have to clean  up. You do not need to worry about defragmenting or compressing the goat. The goat does not have to be zipped, archived or converted to  Goat-32. 

* As long as the stable hasn't caught fire, a goat couldn't care less about a power surge. 

* Goats don't have to be backed up at night.

* Each and every one of the parts of a goat use the same interrupt, and the goat works just fine anyway.

* Nobody ever needed to draft up a goat-milking requirements document.

* You deliver applications to goats. Goats do not deliver applications to you.

* You won't find out from your next phone bill that you milked your goat too much for your budget. 

* On a goat, the SYS$ERR.LOG file is ALWAYS EMPTY.

* Operating systems come & go, but goats will probably never be ""orphaned"" as they are expected to be produced by their manufacturer for quite some time to come.

* You don't get in trouble for milking a goat during business hours,  and nobody cares if you reformat it. 

* If it's late and you have a lot of goat-milking to do, at least you can see your kids before they have to go to bed. You can probably even make them help you milk your goats. 

* You don't need 32 megs of RAM to get started milking your goat.

* Goat security is applied completely, thoroughly, and with all the features you'll ever need, using a stake and a rope. 

* Nobody ever got a general protection fault milking a goat.

* You don't need to worry about your whole goat herd locking up if you  put an ethernet goat and a token-ring goat together in the same stable. 

* You don't name goats. If you do name goats, you can give two or more goats the same name and this will not interfere with your ability to access any of the goats. 

* Your kids will not meet some pervert who wants to buy them a bus  ticket when they play with a goat. 

* There is no closely-watched dispute between Microsoft and any competitor, over who will dominate the goat-milking product industry. You will probably never be asked to check-mark a box that says, Make this my default goat-milking bucket. 

* You do not want, need, or desire in any way for goats to run at a  higher clock speed. And they don't. 

* You do not need to use a wrist strap to ground yourself before  milking, and there's never a need to put your goat in a little  plastic baggie. Unless making goat steak  

* There really aren't too many ways to improperly shut down a goat.

* Surrounded by a room full of younger goat farmers, you don't need to worry about dating yourself talking about 300-baud or 4.7-Mhz goats. 

* y2k.

* You do not need to buy anything to ""uninstall"" a goat. Maybe a gun  or a knife. 

* Once you've filled a bucket with goat milk, the goat can crash and  it doesn't matter whether you've ""saved"" or not. Just don't spill.

* Goats don't drive technology dollars away from your automobile lusts.

* If a goat takes a ""dump"" in the middle of the night, you take care of it when you damn well feel like it. 

* Nobody will fire you for connecting ""diskless goats"" into a ""goat server"" when they think you should have purchased a massive mainframe goat to connect to a multitude of inexpensive ""dumb goats"". 

* ISO is not publishing any standards about how you should be farming your goats. 

* Counting from zero instead of one, doesn't apply to anything goat farmers do and looks stupid. Hexadecimal is unheard of. 

* When you sell a goat, you don't need to export it to a format that will be understood by the buyer's ancient goat-reading software. 

* All your stuff will still work when you buy your 100th goat, and your 256th goat, and your 65,536th goat... 

* People don't walk up to goat farmers at parties and whine about how they just got a French Alpine and don't know how to milk it. 

* Nobody can go through your goat and get you in trouble for what they find in there. 

* You don't have to administer a ""user acceptance test"" when you deliver goat cheese. 

* You don't need any special utilities to delete a goat that is  not empty. 

* You don't need or want goats on your desktop, or shortcuts to goats on your desktop. Most goat farmers don't have desktops. 

* Nothing a goat farmer does requires a mouse. If you have mice you get a cat. 

* Goat farmer error messages: Goat not found; Goat dead; Goat not awake; Too soon after last milking; Billy goat detected. That's about all. You don't need silly numbers for these, and you don't  need to look them up anywhere or check them out at goat.com. 

* There are no read-only oats. There are no hidden or system goats.

* You don't need to mail anyone a core dump from a goat to fix a  problem. The only time you would do this is to CAUSE a problem. 

* A goat that doesn't know what time it is will work just fine.

* A goat that is not Y2K compliant will simply think it's not Y2K. This is doesn't even require documentation.

km0kq3,sysadmin,1609194383.0,"Small Story Time but I wanted to talk about it here because It finally happened to me and It's important for people not to do this.

I have a friend. She's washed through multiple jobs, of every different skillset. Electrician, Mechanic, Carpenter, you name it. About a year ago she asked me if I would help get her into IT. Now I've known this person over 15 years. Point being that I trusted her so when she asked I did my best to help her. She wanted to do what I do which is consulting. I pointed her to my guide to get her started, helped her sign up for some basic entry level classes focused on DEVOPS at a local community college (Basically Linux Scripting, Powershell, Python, Bash, Linux Server Administration, and Windows Server Administration). I even sent her a copy of my resume, my LinkedIn profile, and told her to model her resume after mine (My first mistake).

What she did was completely take my resume, change the contact details, and she started presenting this to employers. I have a few different resume's mostly tailored around specific skillsets depending on the roles I am looking to go after. Most of them include Certification #'s relevant to the role. (Pro-tip: If you are applying to multiple jobs, its very helpful to have different resumes' that call to the skillset you are applying for. For example I have one for Amazon AWS which speaks about the relevant skillsets and projects I've worked on specific to Amazon Clients, and one for VMware.

She found herself being accepted into an IT organization that didn't quite do their homework on her interview and the person hiring for the role didn't bother to vet her actual skills and she was hired on as a contract for a Senior Sys Admin position for 12 months with a rather large federal vendor. I had no idea as I don't keep regular tabs on my friend if she doesn't need me. 

Well, they became suspicious about her about 3 weeks into the role. Unfortunately for her this vendor is a vendor I also do business with. They being suspicious of her actual skillset pulled her into an office and asked her why she was using someone else's licenses as her own to which she did the absolute worse thing you can do and doubled down the lie and said that they were hers' and it must be a case of identity theft. Meanwhile I am completely unaware this is going on as she wasn't saying anything to me about it.

Long story short they did a search and up popped my Resume in their pool of qualified candidates. I was emailed and asked if I was aware of my resume and information being used by her (They were unaware we knew each other) and I said that I was not and inquired further. 

Folks. Don't do this. I had a really long talk with my friend about ethics and how long it took me to get to where I am at in my career and the level of trust she broke with me over this. This is the absolute worst thing you can do in this industry. Not only did she get fired she is now blacklisted from one of the largest contracting agencies in the US. They had roles a plenty for her in the Junior space to help her build her skillset out naturally. Now she will get nothing from them now or in the future. When I asked her why in the world she would ever think to just jack my entire resume as her own she told me she didn't want to be on the phones all day answering calls for printer support. I told her that in any career you have to start at the bottom and work your way up right.

User puts a ticket in with a picture. It was trying to net boot because no boot drive was found. Immediately suspected a failed drive, so asked him to leave it in the office and grab a spare and I'd take a look

Got into the office the next day and opened it up to replace the drive. Was greeted with the M.2 SSD completely unslotted from the connector. The screw was barely holding it down. I pulled it all the way out only to find the entire bracket that holds it down was just a piece of metal that had been slipped under the motherboard and was more or less balanced there. Horrendous quality control

The cheaper Vostro and Inspiron laptops always were a little shit, and would develop faults after a while, but the Latitude laptops were solid and unbreakable. These days, every model Dell makes seems to be a steaming pile of manure

We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we'd send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying

But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We'd never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we'd made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I've now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working

3chn22,sysadmin,1436313229.0,"I just took a new job last week and I was expecting an absolute horror of a situation the former admin left 2 months ago after redundancy and there has only been help-desk and a contractor managing any issues in the interim.

So first day I walked in met the CTO and he explained I had to go through a security induction and would be a week before I touched a computer, warning bells started to kick in but I went with it since who am I to say what I should have access to on my first day.


So after the first week I was handed an envelope which contained a combination to a safe, inside that safe I found a USB pen drive a laptop and a post-it with login credentials. 

when logging into the machine using the provided credentials I found the holy grail of a handover. 

First off every system had 20-30 pages of documentation, RDCMan was set up with every server on the domain and putty had every switch on the network ( excluding the DMZ )
 
It got better as I found two keepass vaults on the desktop, one of the vaults contained every password to all the service accounts detailed explanation of what it was used for and also when it was to be changed. 

Every supplier & Active account we have with third parties were notified of my former leaving and I was provided a list of their contact details along with the reps awaiting my calls to hand over accounts etc to myself. 

Backups - Looking at the system there is multiple systems performing backups none of which have failed in several months along. SAN replication + Netbackup + Veeam + Three QNAPs 

Cryptlocker - Exchange has comprehensive rules in place, everything with a zip is held by Helpdesk and they inspect it, they then extract the file and drop it in a file share for the user, Applocker is in place with a white list and no zip software is installed on any machines. 

Service Desk - He went through and re-opened around 50-60 tickets and assigned notes to them along with documentation on how they were resolved in the past, how he automated their fixes (mainly UNIX boxes which have low disk capacity and large logs) 

Over and above that the only things I have to do is shut down a single server 2003 box which is running in VMware ( he left a note explaining that it's no longer needed but wanted me to shut down the last one)  

Right now I am waiting on a second envelope to a second safe once my second batch of security clearance comes in but I am told that the Domain and network which is held within the safe is ultra secure for milatary contracts and even better organised, I really don't know how but I feel like I won the lottery.

I've saved up a few months just in case a SHTF moment, passed new employers background, drug screening, various tests, etc before I put in my notice, I even started pushing myself *more* just to make sure I keep up with my job as well as create transition documents.

Today, 1 week into my notice, my current employer **told** me I had install 10+ speaker stereo system in a call center this week. Like in the drop-ceiling, running cable etc. We don't have the equipment for this. The last time I ran a network drop I broke my phone (My flashlight) and was covered in insulation all day. For once, my pushover-passive-aggressive-self just blankly told them ""No."" They asked me what I meant. (I'm not good with confrontation so I either disengage or just go all out. (It's a bad trait I know.)) I blurted out something along the lines of ""I don't need to be here. None of you are my references. I have plenty of money saved and I start a new position the Monday after my planned last Friday here. I'm here as a courtesy. I'm not installing a stereo system in this place by myself within a week. I'll just leave.""

They just looked at me, and said ""We'll think about it."" I assume to save face because I was never asked to leave.

Seriously, a former coworker with a kid, wife, and all was fired without warning because of something out of his control. Companies expect you to give them two weeks but often just end your employment right on the spot. Fuck these people.

/rant

Edit: It was a higher level call center executive that tried to push me into it. Not anyone in the IT department. (Ofc this got back to my boss.) My bosses and co-workers are my references, they wished me the best. Unfortunately my boss didn't care either way, if I struggled through installing it or not. Ultimately though, I doubt anyone is going to reach out to this call center guy for a backdoor reference. Bridges burned? Maybe, maybe not.

9k2mf2,sysadmin,1538273681.0,"As I enter into the latter half of 30, I notice, more and more, a certain type of toxicity in the American work environment. The person who works after hours and feels good about it.

I just can’t understand how people can’t see that their email sent at 8pm or their project updates at 2pm on a Saturday is essentially putting it on other people to work after hours as well. 

I was talking to a coworker who said he was coming into work over the weekend. This is an older guy who is divorced, a lot of his value is in his job. He had no outside hobbies and will be completely destroyed when he is forced to retire and realizes that he is just a cog in the machine of business. 

What is this American obsession with working too much and seeing it as a positive thing? Why is work/life balance so hard of a concept for people to try to push and strive for? Do people not like their hobbies? Do they not feel valued at home? Do they feel that work is the end all and be all to life?

Sorry for the rant post, just frustrated to see this same old song and dance year after year, job after job.

All I ask is for people to remember those after hours emails that you didn’t have time to send during the day, are essentially forcing someone else to put in more time than they have in their day.

Edit: My word, I’ve hit a pythons nest. It really is interesting to hear how divisive this subject is.

Edit2: There has been a huge mix of thought out replies, some insults, some defending the right to work for free as much as one wants and everything in between. I’ve always found us in /r/sysadmin to be a salty bunch, often arguing just to argue, it seems to be in our nature.

Edit3: I woke up to 101 replies, I read them all but it’s just too much to respond to. Most of them are around me being lazy or people arguing that they like their job and should be able to work as much as they like...to make it more simple, I’ll just add these few points 

-It’s fine to like your job and enjoy your work. It’s dangerous to derive your personal value from your job. After 30-40 years of working nonstop, you retire. They have a party for you....and no one thinks about you ever again. 

Do something useful with that time instead of making someone else money. Spend time with your family. If you don’t have a family, volunteer (I volunteer at the animal shelter and parks services, I beautify my neighborhood and help abandoned dogs find homes. This is a better use of time instead of making my boss more money).

-My post was only about salaried workers. If your hourly, work and make those dollars, more power to you. I wish we were all hourly as companies would force people to work less because...guess what? They don’t want to actually pay for all the free working hours you’re currently giving them.

-I guess the final thing I have to say is that people working more makes other people work more, or at least sets the expectation. If several people start working all the time, send data after hours and work on projects after hours, that sets a bad expectation for everyone else. We don’t live in a vacuum, things we do in our lives affect others. Those that want to work after hours a lot, negatively impact those of us that want to work the hours we were hired for.

I put in my 40-45 and that’s the way it should be. Working more for free is not something to be proud of.

10h4clv,sysadmin,1674239381.0,"Hey folks,

Todays an odd day. I’ve worked with the company I’m still employed by for the last 10 years- I’ve gone from ‘helping out with computers’ as a side part of my role when I was 19 to being a solo sysadmin- for which I’ve been doing the duties for over the last 8 years.

It’s a relatively small business- two facilities in a specialized part of the geriatric healthcare industry with roughly 125-150 users. Although I’ve worked hand in hand with an MSP for majority of that time I’m the only actual employee for the company who understands networking, the actual structure of our network, and most importantly I’m the only one who seems to understand how all the systems interact with each other including our SaaS components.

After the hell that was the pandemic- and an otherwise tumultuous situation that had seen turnover approach 80-85% within the past half year- I’ve been feeling burnt out, largely unsupported, and ultimately fed up with how the new management team is choosing to address issues that have been growing more and more potentially compromising as systems continue to go past their EoL

Just to summarize- we’re still running an on-Prem exchange/MO 2010 environment, a Terminal server environment running on 2008r2 (meaning 1/4th of users are on windows 7), while our DC/FS servers are all running on 2016.

I’ve been adamant since roughly 2018 that these issues need to be addressed from a security standpoint. So much so that I think it has created a bit of the situation I’m now encountering

The administration (3rd generation of family owned business)- and myself had a sit down yesterday. I expressed some of the personal issues I’ve had with how they’ve handled a half dozen situations with former employees, projects that were started and derailed part-way through due to funding cuts, and a general state of affairs that I couldn’t continue to be a part of going forward.

The owner (or I should say the owner’s child) responded with denial and indicated distrust in myself- going as far as accusing me of intending to compromise our systems in the event that I left as some sort of ‘revenge’ scheme. 

Come to find out today that this same person has repeated these concerns to H/R, and several of my co-workers, who all approached me today to let me know what was being said (shocker, if you’re honest and straight forward with most people- they’ll tend to actually to be the same with you).

I’ve known the writing has been on the wall with this company for a few months now, but the absolutely paranoid response (which I should also mention, is completely fabricated) I’ve received has raised genuine concerns about how I should proceed.

Other than the fact that they’re still wanting me to stay here (although that behavior indicates otherwise)- what steps should I take to protect myself going forward? My next plan of action is to reach out to my contacts at our MSP- perhaps having them visibly show ownership that they’re taking control of all of my service accounts is the only way I can ensure that the inevitable issues they run into don’t fall back on myself.

I obviously don’t appreciate the instability, and having a young family doesn’t make sitting in limbo an ideal situation, however it’s pretty evident that I need to separate myself from this entity as fast as possible. Any advice on other steps I should take here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10h4clv/employer_has_accused_me_of_planning_to_sabotage/,Employer has accused me of planning to sabotage the company after I announced that I plan to depart.,Rant,1685,523,0.96
hxdl7h,sysadmin,1595637979.0,"I'm legitimately shocked and in disbelief about what just happened to me today.

**Background**: A few years ago, I purchased a Canon MF216n for $50 from someone who was complaining about how it kept printing ""streaks"". Turns out the toner cartridge just needed to be replaced and I managed to get a solid 3 years out of this bad boy so far. 

**Today**: I was sent over a bevvy of papers, mostly NDA agreements and payment documents for a new freelance gig I got. I hadn't set up scanning before, having just used the drivers Windows automatically downloaded up to now, so I downloaded the toolkit and started the installation process. Here's where the first twist in our story happens. The drivers didn't come with *any* bloatware. No ads in the installer, no free antivirus trials, *nothing*. Just a single executable that installed a single program that put a single icon on my desktop when it was done. I didn't even need to reboot!

Now, the rest of this story gets a little unbelievable, so I don't blame anyone if the first thing to come to mind after this next paragraph is a hefty amount of skepticism. I ran the program called Canon MF Toolbox 4.9. A clean, spartan dialogue pops up with 9 buttons: a few scan options and settings. I open the settings menu first (as you do) and was surprised to learn that the toolbox had *already* found my Canon and set it as the default scanner. 

Please, if you'll only stay with me a moment longer. The last thing that happened is unbelievably miraculous, but I have proof! I clicked the button labeled ""PDF"". A dialogue box popped up with a few printing options. I gave them a quick once-over and hit the big green ""Start"" button. To my utter shock and delight, I hear the sound of two of the pages whirling through the machine. The printer emitted a delightful ""Job complete!"" chirp and there was a new folder on my desktop. In it was a two-page PDF file with my signed NDA in crisp black-and-white.

The best part of all this? It took [less than a minute](https://i.imgur.com/XLDn6eB.png) between finishing the toolkit installation and having the file ready to email on my desktop.

To the software and printer engineers at Canon, I salute you. You've brought a light to this old techie's dark life and given me hope for humanity.

ltomo0,sysadmin,1614434194.0,"**A malicious actor with access to a host compromised in your network with access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.**

CVE-2021-21974, as the security flaw is tracked, is a remote code-execution vulnerability in VMware vCenter server, an application for Windows or Linux that administrators use to enable and manage virtualization of large networks. Within a day of [VMware issuing a patch](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html), proof-of-concept exploits [appeared](https://gist.github.com/milo2012/9ba4ac8bb0dfa59497d02b27d820eeb5) from [at](https://github.com/NS-Sp4ce/CVE-2021-21972) [least](http://noahblog.360.cn/vcenter-6-5-7-0-rce-lou-dong-fen-xi/) [six](https://github.com/QmF0c3UK/CVE-2021-21972-vCenter-6.5-7.0-RCE-POC) [different](https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2021-21972) [sources](https://github.com/yaunsky/CVE-2021-21972). The severity of the vulnerability, combined with the availability of working exploits for both Windows and Linux machines, sent hackers scrambling to actively find vulnerable servers.

“We’ve detected mass scanning activity targeting vulnerable VMware vCenter servers ([https://vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html](https://vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html)),”

## Unfettered code execution, no authorization required

CVE-2021-21972 allows hacker with no authorization to upload files to vulnerable vCenter servers that are publicly accessible over port 443, researchers from security firm Tenable [said](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2021-21972-vmware-vcenter-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability?utm_source=charge&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=internal-comms). Successful exploits will result in hackers gaining unfettered remote code-execution privileges in the underlying operating system. The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the vRealize Operations plugin, which is installed by default.

The flaw has received a severity score of 9.8 out of 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.0. Mikhail Klyuchnikov, the Positive Technologies researcher who discovered the vulnerability and privately reported it to VMware, compared the risk posed by CVE-2021-21972 to that of [CVE-2019-19781](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/unpatched-citrix-vulnerability-now-exploited-patch-weeks-away/), a critical vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery Controller.

CVE-2021-21972 affects vCenter Server versions 6.5, 6.7, and 7.01. Users running one of these versions should update to 6.5 U3n, 6.7 U3l, or 7.0 U1c as soon as possible. Those who can’t immediately install a patch should implement [these workarounds](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/82374), which involve changing a compatibility matrix file and setting the vRealize plugin to incompatible. Admins who have vCenter servers directly exposed to the Internet should strongly consider curbing the practice or at least using a VPN.

Yesterday I was happily plunking along on a project when a bunch of people DM'd me about this post that blew up on r/sysadmin: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cd3bu4/the_problem_of_runaway_job_descriptions_being/

It's hard to approach this post with the typical tongue-in-cheek format as I usually do because I see some very genuine concerns and frustrations on what the job market looks like today for a traditional ""sysadmin"", and the increasing difficulty of meeting these demands and expectations.

First; **If you are not automating your job in 2019, you are at-risk. Staying competitive in this market is only going to get harder moving forward.**

I called this out in my December PSAs and many sysadmins who are resistant to change who claimed ""oh, it's always been like this,"" or ""this is unrealistic, this can't affect ME! I'm in a unique situation where mom and pop can't afford or make sense of any automation efforts!"" are now complaining about job description scope creep and technology advancement that is slowly but surely making their unchanged skill sets obsolete.

Let's start with the big picture. All jobs across America are already facing a quickly approaching reality of being automated by a machine, robot, or software solution.

Sysadmins are at the absolute forefront of this wave given we work with information technology and directly impact the development and delivery of these technologies-- whether your market niche is shipping, manufacturing, consumer product development, administrative logistics, or data service such as weather/geo/financial/etc, it doesn't matter who or what you do as a sysadmin. You are affected by this!

A quick history lesson; About 12-14 years ago, the bay area and silicon valley exploded with multiple technologies and services that truly transformed the landscape of web application development and infrastructure configuration management. Ruby, Rails (Ruby on Rails), Puppet, Microsoft's WSUS, Git, Reddit, Youtube, Pandora, Google Analytics, and uTorrent all came out within the same time frame. (2005 was an insanely productive year).
Lots of stuff going on here, so buckle in. Ruby on Rails blew up and took the world by storm, shaking up traditional php webdevs and increasing demand for skillset in metro areas tenfold. Remember the magazine articles that heralded rails devs as the big fat cash cow moneymakers back then? Sound familiar? (hint: *DevOps Engineers on LinkedIn*)

To quote goodaudience:
>The Rails framework assist programmers to build websites and apps by abstracting and simplifying most of the repetitive tasks.

The key here is `abstracting and simplifying`. We'll get back to this later on, as it's a recurring theme throughout our history.

Around the same time, some major platforms were making a name for themselves:
- Youtube - revolutionized learning accessibility
- Pandora - helped define the pay-for-service paradigm (before netflix took this crown) and also enforced the mindset of developing *web applications instead of native desktop apps*
- Reddit - meta information gathering
- Google Analytics - demand, traffic, brand exposure
- uTorrent - one of the first big p2p vehicles to evolve past limewire and napster, which helped define the need for content delivery networks such as Akamai, which solves the problem of near-locale content distribution and high bandwidth resource availability

To solve modern problems back in 2005, Google was developing [Borg](https://www.linux.com/news/learn/chapter/Intro-to-Kubernetes/2017/4/how-googles-borg-inspired-modern-datacenter), an orchestration engine to help scale their infrastructure to handle the rapid growth and demand for information and services, and in doing so developed a *methodology* for handling service development and lifecycle: today, we call this DevOps. 12 years ago, it had no official name and was simply what Google did internally to manage the vast scale of infrastructure they needed. Today (2019) they are practicing what the industry refers to as Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) which is a matured and focused perspective of DevOps practices that covers end to end accountability of services and software... from birth to death. These methodologies were created in order to solve problems and manage infrastructure without having to throw bodies at it. To quote The [Google Site Reliability Engineering Handbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/):

>By design, it is crucial that SRE teams are focused on engineering. Without constant engineering, operations load increases and teams will need more people just to keep pace with the workload. Eventually, **a traditional ops-focused group scales linearly with service size**: if the products supported by the service succeed, the operational load will grow with traffic. **That means hiring more people to do the same tasks over and over again.**

>To avoid this fate, **the team tasked with managing a service needs to code or it will drown**. Therefore, Google places a **50% cap on the aggregate ""ops"" work for all SREs—tickets, on-call, manual tasks, etc.** This cap ensures that the SRE team has enough time in their schedule to make the service stable and operable.

After some time, Google needed to rewrite Borg and started writing [Omega](https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/05/05/google-omega-to-become-part-of-borg-collective/), which did not quite pan out as planned and gave us what we call [Kubernetes](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-kubernetes/) today. This can all be read in the book [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)

At the same exact time in 2005, [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)) had latched onto the surge of Ruby skillset emergence and produced the first serious enterprise-ready configuration management platform (apart from [CFEngine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine)) that allowed people to define and *abstract* their infrastructure into config management code with their Ruby-based DSL. It's declarative-- big enterprises (not many at the time) began exploring this tech and started automating configs and deployment of resources on virtual infrastructure in order to keep themselves from linearly scaling their workforce to tackle big infra, which is what Google set out to achieve on their own with Borg, Omega, and eventually Kubernetes in our modern age.

## What does this mean for us sysadmins?

DevOps, infrastructure as code, and SRE practices are trickling through the groundwater and reaching the mom and pop shops, the small orgs, startups, and independent firms. These practices were experimented and defined over a decade ago, and the reason why you're seeing so much of it explode is that everyone else is *just now starting to catch up.*

BEFORE YOU RUN DOWN TO THE COMMENT SECTION to scream at me and bitch and moan about how this still doesn't affect you, and how DevOps is such horse shit, let me clarify some things.

# The man, the myth, the legend: the DevOps Engineer.
DevOps is not a job title. It's not a job. It's an organizational culture-mindset and methodology. The reason why you are seeing ""DevOps Engineer"" pop up all over the place is that companies are hiring people to implement tooling and preach the practices needed to instill the conceptual workings of *working in a DevOps manner*. This is mainly targeting engineering silos, communication deficiencies, and poor accountability. The goal is to get you and everyone to stop putting their hands directly on machines and virtual infrastructure and learn to declare the infrastructure as code so you can execute the intent and **abstract the manual labor away into repeatable and reusable components**. Remember when Ruby on Rails blew up because it gave devs a new way of abstracting shit? Guess what, it's never been more accessible than now for infrastructure engineers A.K.A. sysadmins. The goal is for *everyone* to practice DevOps, and to work in this paradigm instead of doing everything manually in silos.

# Agile and Scrum is warm and fuzzy BS
Agile and Scrum are buzzword practices much like DevOps that are used to get people to talk to their customers, and stay on time with delivering promised features. Half the people out there don’t practice it correctly, because they don’t understand the big picture of what it’s for. This is not a goldmine, this is common sense. These practices aren't some magical ritual. Agile is the opposite of waterfall(aka waterfail) delivery models: don't just assume you know what your internal and external customers want. Don't just give them 100% of a pile of crap and be done with it. Deliver 10%, talk to them about it, give them another 10%, talk to them about it, until you have a polished and well-used solution, and hopefully a long-term service. Think about when Netflix first came out, and all the incremental changes they delivered since their inception. Are you collecting feedback from your users as well as they are? Are you limiting scope creep and delivering on those high-value objectives and features? This is what Scrum/Agile and Kanban try to impart. Don't fall into the trap of becoming a [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

#Automation is here to stay, but you might not be.
Tooling aside (I am not going to get into all the tools that are associated and often mistaken for “DevOps”), each and every one of you needs to be actively learning new things and figuring out how to incorporate automation into your current practices.

There are a few additional myths I want to debunk:

##The falsehood of firefighting and “too busy to learn/change”
We call this the equilibrium. In IT, you are doing one of two things: falling behind work, or getting ahead of work. This should strike true with anyone-- that there is always a list of things to do, and it never goes away completely. You are never fully “on top” of your workload. Everyone is constantly pushed to get more things done with less resources than what is thought to be required. If you are getting ahead of work, that means you have reduced the complexity of your tasking and figured out how to automate or accomplish more with less toil. This is what we refer to when we say “abstract”. If you can’t possibly build the tower of Alexandria with a hammer and chisel, learn how to use a backhoe and crane instead.

At what point while the boat is sinking with hundreds of holes do we decide to stop shoveling buckets full of water and begin to patch the holes? What is the root of your toil, the main timesink? How can we eliminate this timesink and bottleneck?

Instead of manually building your boxes, from undocumented, human-touched inconsistent work, you need to put down your proverbial hammer and chisel and learn to use the backhoe and crane. This is what we use modern “DevOps” tooling and methodologies for.

##I’ll automate myself out of a job.
Stop it! Stop thinking like this. It’s shortsighted. The demand for engineers is constantly growing. This goes back to the equilibrium: if you aren’t getting ahead of work, how could you possibly automate yourself out of a job? Automation simply enables you to accomplish more, and if you are a good engineer who teaches others how to work more efficiently, you will become invaluable and indispensable to your company. Want to stop working on shitty service calls and helpdesk tickets about the same crap over and over? Abstract, reduce complexity, automate, and enable yourself and others to work on harder problems instead of doing the same shit over and over. You already identified that your workload isn’t getting lighter. So get ahead of it. There is always a person who needs to maintain the automation and robots. Be that person.

##This doesn’t apply to me/We’re doing fine/I don’t have funding to do any of this
Majority of the tools and education needed to do all of this is free, open source, or openly available on the internet in the form of website tutorials and videos.

A lot of time, your business will treat IT as a cost center. That’s fine. The difference between a technician and engineer is that a technician will wait to be told what to do, and an engineer identifies a problem and builds a solution. Figure out what your IT division is suffering from the most and brainstorm how you can tackle that problem with automation and standardization. Stop being satisfied with being second rate. Have pride in your work and always challenge the status quo. Again, the tools are free, the knowledge is free, you just need to put down the hammer and get your ass in the crane.

Your company may have been trying to grow for a long time, and perhaps a blocker for you is not enough personnel. Try to solve your issues from a non-linear standpoint. Throwing more bodies at a problem won’t solve the root issue. Be an engineer, not a technician.

A whole other discussion is what tools to learn, what to build, how to build it. Lots of seasoned orgs leverage atlassian products (bamboo, bitbucket, confluence, jira (jira is a popular one). There are currently three large ""DevOps as a Service"" platforms(don't ever coin this term, for the love of god, please). GitLab CE/EE, Microsoft's Azure DevOps, and Amazon's Code* PaaS (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, etc.).

Why GitLab? It's free. Like, really free. Install it in EE mode without a license and it runs in CE mode, and you get almost all the features you'd need to build out a full infra automation backbone for any enterprise. It's also becoming a defacto standard in all net-new enterprise deployments I've personally seen and consulted on. Learn it, love it.

With GitLab, you're going to have a gateway drug into what most people fuck up with DevOps: Continuous Integration. Tired of spinning up a VM, running some code, then doing a snapshot rollback? Cool. Have a gitlab runner in your stack do it for you on each push, and tell you if something failed automatically. You don't need to install Jenkins and run into server sprawl. Gitlab can do it all for you.

Having an SCM platform in your network and learning to **live out of it** is one of the biggest hurdles I see. Do that early, and you'll make your life easy.

- Learn Ansible/Chef/Saltstack

Learn a config management tool. Someone commented down below that ""Scripting is fine, at some point microsoft is going to write the scripts for you"" guess what? That's what a config management tool is. It's a collection of already tested and modular scripts that you simply pass variables into (called modules). For linux, learn python. Windows? Powershell. These are the languages these modules are written in. Welcome to idempotent infra as code 101. When we say ""declarative"", we mean you really only need to write down what you want, and have someone's script go make that happen for you. Powershell DSC was MSFT's attempt at this but unless you want to deal with dependency management hell, i'd recommend a better tool like the above. I didn't mention Puppet because it's simply old, the infra is annoying to manage, the Ruby DSL is dated in comparison to newer tools that have learned from it. Thank you Puppet for paving the way, but there's better stuff out there. Chef is also getting long in the tooth, but hey, it's still good. YMMV, don't let my recommendations stop you from exploring. They all have their merits.

Do something simple, and achievable. Think patching. Write a super simple playbook that makes your boxes seek out patches, or get a windows toast notification sent to someone's desktop. https://devdocs.io/ansible~2.7/modules/win_toast_module 

**version control all the things.**

From here, you can start to brainstorm what you want to do with SCM and a config tool. Start looking into a package repository, since big binaries like program installers, tarballs, etc don't belong in source control. Put it in Artifactory or Nexus. Go from there.

P.S. If you're looking at Ansible, and you work on windows, go to your windows features and enable *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL). Then after that's enabled and rebooted, go to the microsoft app store and install Ubuntu 16 or 18, and follow the ansible install guides from there. Microsoft is investing in WSL, soon to release WSL2 (with a native linux kernel) because of the growing need for tools like these, and the ability to rapidly to develop on docker, or even docker-in-docker in some cases.

Caught up? Good.

so i emailed the email address that was in the ransomware asking how much money they wanted

They said they want $5,000 in bitcoin

So I photoshopped a fake android app screenshot with a transaction of 0.70003492 bitcoin on the day

and they promptly sent me a file called ""decrypt.exe"" which provided me with a ""key"" that i need to send back to them

they also asked for confirmation

so i went to the bitcoin transaction log online, and found a real transaction that was as close to that amount as possible, around the same time

sent them the fake transaction ID, and the amount, with the key generated by their program

within 5 minutes they sent me the decryption key and I got all my data back

Yep. ***I social engineered them into decrypting my data.***

10zlt2i,sysadmin,1676116028.0,"Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things.
But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours.
It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call ""we need till"" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.

I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was ""First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest"".

Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.

IT is not a revenue generating department, sorry, some of the faces that you see daily won’t be coming back.  

Over years I’ve had discussions with various leaders and I’ve asked some questions, here and there.  Plant Operations, (maintenance) do they generate revenue?  No, but when the lights go out or a pipe bursts they’re needed to keep the facility running.  

What about Environmental Services, do they generate revenue? No, but they’re necessary to keep the facility clean and they drive patient satisfaction.

Share these basic security tips:
  
* Never expose RDP services to the internet.  
-Do not ""Port Forward"" 3389

* Obscurity is not Security.  
-Changing RDP to use another port number does not provide additional security.

* Always use 2 Factor Authentication.

* Setup a VPN  - Every business class Firewall supports VPN.  

* Find a trusted, third party Remote Access Tool.


#Having issues or questions about setting up a VPN?

#What do you recommend for third party remote access?

You can’t use Azure,GCP and last month DigitalOcean followed suit

Many software,services like dockerhub,mongodb,golang,gitlab,jira blocked iranian access

It’s REALLY HARD to be a sysadmin here

After a lot of years, the kids are grown, the bills are paid, and I'm in a place where I don't need to make a pile of cash to be happy.

So, I took a job at a local college.  I get amazing benefits, a chance to pad my retirement, and  I actually believe in what I am doing.  I get up, do my best to help kids in school, then go home.  The new job is literally blocks from my house.

No more early middle of the night / early morning calls.

No more late night bullshit.  No more ""emergencies.""  If I do get called in, I walk up, then go in late the next day.

Not to be daunting but I practised this talk for over a year before I had guts enough to present and I'm a people person who isn't afraid of teaching class.  Rehearse in your car, at work, at home, on the dog.  Don't care, just know what sort of things you'll say for each slide.  Practice until you can do it in your dreams, make people laugh, engage them.  You'll be fine.

Probably spent 160+ hours working on this.  The slides are nothing.  It's *what* I talk about and *how* I talk about it that count.  Steal the slides and *work* on this.

Take this as a skeleton and flesh it out on your own.  Take an hour or two and research the things I talk about.  Tailor this to your own environment and users.  Make it *relevant* to your people.  Include corporate stories, include your audience, *exclude yourself*.  

This ain't about how smart you are at infosec, and I can't stress this enough, talk about how people can *defend* themselves.  Give them things to *look* for and *action* they can take.  No one gives a shit about your firewall rules.

x8rqhd,sysadmin,1662615358.0,"So just got through a frustrating day at work as the only IT person for my company on the continent , as the only other person is a ocean away dealing with the companies other offices.

And one of the biggest frustrations today was that we had several assorted issues, but so few of them used the ticket system, instead going straight to teams, email or my personal cell phone.

&#x200B;

I am so sick and tired of people from work calling, texting or whatsapping (yes my company uses whatsapp for several communications, its worse then it sounds) for help as they don't have the decency to go through the proper channels .

&#x200B;

I learned on my first helpdesk job personally why you don't give out your desk number or cellphone.

The older staff told me not to do it, I didn't think much of it, if they need to contact me back, why not give them my extension?

&#x200B;

I soon learned that was opening the flood gates for people to try and contact me directly to solve their issues, instead of getting it in the help desk queue.

Even if it was not my sub-department or something I had no  control over.

It got so annoying to have someone call you for help that either you couldn't help as you didn't have the skills or you did , but you were working on something else important already and you can't drop everything for them.

&#x200B;

When I came to my current IT job (which has several issues), i mentally recalled to try and avoid this issue as long as possible.

Unfortunately my company is a hot mess and I didn't get a company phone (either desk or cell) until like 6+ months later, so management gave out my cell without my consent to the various managers if they need me.

Made all the worse when having to contact software support companies for all our proprietary stuff and that often crossed international lines.

Eventually I built up $450 in international fees and made he company pay, that finally got them to give me a desk phone...one that doesn't have a dedicated extension and shares a line with the gift shop for the property, but i can call out internationally for support now.

But now having worked there nearly a year now   and my personal  number has spread around the world for the company.

So despite being the junior guy in the IT department, at least a few times a week (often more)

I get several employees who don't have the decency to submit a helpdesk ticket and say ***""hey originaltacomnoey its so and so (often never meeting you physically) are you able to drop everything and help me ? ""***

&#x200B;

Screw those people with rusty server rack. I am so sick and tired of dealing with people on clock who don't do helpdesk tickets and off the clock contact me on the phone , invading my time off.

They treat me like a full time salaried employee with how they clock, but I don't even get full time hours regularly and no health plan.

&#x200B;

So for those of you getting into IT, don't give out any phone number if you can avoid it to the general staff.

> [In a letter](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5983600-Citrix-letter-to-California-attorney-general.html) to California’s attorney general, the virtualization and security software maker said the hackers had “intermittent access” to its internal network from October 13, 2018 until March 8, 2019, two days after the FBI alerted the company to the breach.

kfh90x,sysadmin,1608279753.0,"UPDATE: He called me today asking ME for help on how fix the issue :D :D :D :D :D :D. 

I am a consultant. Client had a major issue at their business that was completely disrupting their business. This client also contracts another consultant from another company. That consultant has been there longer than my company and while we don't report to him we kinda defer to him on decisions per the client's request. We worked late into the night on Tuesday, and came in early on Wednesday to fix the problem the client had. The other consulant was aware of the issue but let us work on it. 

I was in charge of fixing the last major problem. I fixed it Wednesday afternoon with his permission (this important) and then I let him know so he could confirm its working. Ball is in his court. 

I found out that today that the problem I fixed was only like 95% fixed and was therefore still causing issue. The other guy didn't do any testing like I asked.

Then this afternoon this Consultant texted the owners of our client saying that we jacked everything up, that we didn't communicate or let him know what I was doing and that I am ""a complete novice"" at my job. Wow. I have been doing my job for 13 years and I am the top consulant in my company. I have also fixed many many issues over the years that were CAUSED by this other consultant due to his incompetence.

Don't worry, there is a happy ending. My bosses/owners of our consulting firm heard about this guy trying to throw me under the bus... and the best way I can describe their reaction was ""pissed off over protective mama grizzly bear""

Long story short, I am grateful to work where management has our backs and will stand up and fight for us. And then the icing in the cake for today? I got my first gold!

Each week I thought I'd post these SysAdmin tools, tips, tutorials etc with [just one link to get it in your inbox each week](https://www.everycloud.com/it-pro-tuesdays). Let me know any ideas for future versions in the comments.

This week is a mega list of all the items we've featured to date, broken down into categories, for you to explore at your leisure. I hope you enjoy it. 

&#x200B;

**Free Tools**

[mRemoteNG](https://mremoteng.org/) is the next generation of mRemote, open source, tabbed, multi-protocol, remote connections manager. This was recommended to us by 'Oliviamcc’ who firmly believes ""it is much better than Putty (SSH), Citrix, VNC, RDC, etc. ""Make sure you figure out the credentials hierarchy, it works a treat and saves time every day"".

[MailFlow Monitor](https://www.everycloud.com/free-mail-flow-monitor) is EveryCloud's free, cloud-based, round-trip tool that sends you an alert as soon as there is an issue with your email flow. Settings are adjustable to allow you to choose how much of a delay is acceptable and which types of bounce alerts you want to see. Helps you get to the bottom of a problem before users have even noticed it.

[TreeSize Free](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/). Find and free up your or your user's free space. TreeSize Free tells you where precious disk space has gone. I've seen this recommended in too many places to mention. 

[PDQ Inventory and Deploy](https://www.pdq.com/download/). A software deployment tool used to keep Windows PCs up-to-date without bothering end users and a systems management tool for tracking and organizing hardware, software, and Windows configuration data.

[Clean](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clean/id418412301?mt=12). I use this on my Mac to automatically move my desktop files into monthly folders each day. It saves a load of time because I just save all files to my desktop and they're then processed later that day. I appreciate a lot of people will want windows equivalent but I can't find anything, so please leave comments on the [blog post](https://medium.com/systems-adventures/it-pro-tuesday-4-53669ee0226d) or reply to this email and I'll include the best one next week.

[trace32.exe | cmtrace.exe](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/9125.vmm-troubleshooting-tools-trace32-and-textanalysistool.aspx). *""It's part of Microsofts SCCM suite from a few years ago, can open very large log files and display them as they update in real time. Has saved me an insane amount of time over the years. Also looks cool and is portable.""* Thank you for the recommendation local\_admin\_user.

[ISPConfig 3.1](https://www.ispconfig.org/ispconfig/) is the next generation of the ISPConfig hosting control panel with a completely renovated UI and a lot of new features.

[BlueScreenView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html) scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes, and displays the information about all crashes in one table.

[Windows System Control Center](http://www.kls-soft.com/wscc/downloads.php) (WSCC) helps to view, organize and launch utilities. It acts as a repository for various utility suites. When installing WSCC for the first time, there is an option to download and install 270 troubleshooting tools.

Check out [Spiceworks Free HelpDesk](https://www.spiceworks.com/free-help-desk-software/) and [Networking Monitoring software](https://www.spiceworks.com/free-network-monitoring-management-software/). We've been recommended these by countless IT Pros over the years.

[Monitor Active Directory Group Membership Change](http://www.lazywinadmin.com/p/monitor-active-directory-group.html). This PowerShell script will monitor the Active Directory groups and notify you by email if a change occurred since the last time it checked.

[ADModify.NET](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=admodify) is a tool primarily utilized by Exchange and Active Directory administrators to facilitate bulk user attribute modifications. 

There is no reason to RDP into a server once you have the [RSAT tools installed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28972). You can manage any aspect of your Windows infrastructure using these tools, and use RunAs if you need to log on as a different user.

[Attack Surface Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=24487). Attack Surface Analyzer takes a snapshot of your system state before and after the installation of product(s) and displays the changes to a number of key elements of the Windows attack surface.

[AWS Free](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). Many people aren't aware that AWS offer a free tier. Here you can create your own practice environment, replicate problems and generally learn a lot.

[The Dell Warranty Checker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dellwarrantychecktool/). Thank you to Matt Fry, EveryCloud's Head of Support for this suggestion. The Dell Warranty Checker allows you to check the warranty on Dell systems. It allows you to enter the service tag to check the warranty or import them via a text file (Checks line by line). You can also export the warranty data to a CSV file to use in other applications.

[NetCrunch Tools 2.0](https://www.adremsoft.com/netcrunch.tools/). 10+ Essential IP tools for administrators including DNS Audit, Ping Scanner, Port Scanner, Network Services Scanner. Thanks mrojek who explained  ""Recently updated freeware from AdRem.12 useful network tools and scanners that runs on Windows"".

[SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/). A tool for easy online testing and sharing of database problems and their solutions. Thanks for the recommendation rosslib who said ""You can build schema and run queries. Good for running a quick test"".

[Regexr](https://regexr.com/). After last weeks regex cheat sheet and number of people recommended RegExr which is an online tool to learn, build, & test Regular Expressions.

[Switch Miner](http://switchminer.sourceforge.net/). Ever have trouble figuring out what's connected where? Switch Miner is a port-discovery tool that can help locate all the devices connected to any switch. This handy utility can also discover and scan neighboring switches via CDP. And best of all, it's free!

[LetsMonitor.org](https://letsmonitor.org/) is a free service that alerts you when your site certificates are misconfigured or nearing expiration. Notifications can be sent to multiple contacts.

[RBLmon](https://www.rblmon.com/) helps you proactively solve mail-delivery issues. This fully automated online service tracks your IP addresses against the most-popular real-time blacklists (RBLs). The moment any of your IP addresses are found in a monitored RBL, RBLmon will send an immediate email notification to alert you, so you can get busy solving the problem.

[WizTree](https://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wiztree-finds-the-files-and-folders-using-the-most-disk-space-on-your-hard-drive/) helps you quickly find the files and folders using the most disk space on your hard drive. Rather than searching the drive and checking each file to determine size, WizTree gets its information straight from the NTFS Master File Table—which means it happens almost instantaneously. While this approach makes WizTree faster than any other type of program in this category, it only works with NTFS filesystems.

[JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com/) is a simple, intuitive Terminal client for Android with SSH, Local Shell, Mosh, and Telnet support. Features a full-color Terminal with adjustable font size, keyboard including special characters, plugins, and key import/export/generation.

**Tips**

**Are you being effective or just efficient?** “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.” This can make all the difference whether you're a SysAdmin, CTO or MSP. The way I think about this is essentially; are you being very organized (effective) working towards your specific goals (effective), or just being organized, feeling good about it, but achieving little. Read more about this in the [""Effective Executive"" by Peter Drucker](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459).

**Speed up your mouse pointer.** Mine is at max. Try it. It's strange for the first hour, then you get used to it and get everything done faster. 

**Windows Key + directional arrows will move and resize windows.** (I.e., Windows Key + Up will maximize the window, windows key + left will snap it to the left of the screen and make it full height, WK + right will do the same but on the right side of the screen, WK + down will minimize the window.)

From greatshittywifi: ""For **Windows desktop cleanup** I just wrote a simple batch script. Make yourself a folder called ""sorted"" or something and in it a subfolder for common file types ""jpg"", ""png"", ""gif"", etc. Then open up notepad, and paste this in:

move \*.jpg ""F:\\sorted\\jpg\\""move \*.png ""F:\\sorted\\png\\""move \*.gif ""F:\\sorted\\gif\\""

Save it with a .bat extension, and voila! I'm sure you could modify this approach to detect file extensions, then mkdirs and move everything from a for loop if you want to go that far.""

**Quickly Find a MAC Address.** Rather than going through network dialog windows or scrolling through long lists via ipconfig, simply open up a command prompt and type getmac. It’s quick, and easy, especially if you have multiple NIC interfaces.

[Import PST files to Office 365 Exchange](https://www.mysysadmintips.com/other/cloud/849-import-pst-files-to-office-365-exchange). For all of you Office 365 users, this is an option you need in your armory. 

Here's a simple trick for **physically tracing unlabelled server-room cables**: Slide a velcro loop or binder clip along the cable until you reach the other end. 

**Use a mobile app barcode scanner to input IT hardware inventory.** Just scan, then copy and paste instead of entering manually. You'll save a little time and eliminate the possibility of introducing typos.

&#x200B;

**Podcasts**

[Sysadmin Today](https://sysadmintoday.com/). EveryCloud was featured on this podcast and it is hosted by a (now) partner of ours, but it's mostly about his experiences as a Sysadmin.

[DevOpsCafe](http://devopscafe.org/). The new Season is now live from this impressive podcast by John Willis & Damon Edwards, which includes interviews and stories from the world of DevOps & System Administration. 

[The Admin Admin Podcast](https://www.adminadminpodcast.co.uk/). A British IT Admin Podcast I stumbled across ""for people who work in the Real world of IT. If you are a sysadmin or want to learn more about servers this podcast is for you.""

[Iron Sysadmin Podcast](https://www.ironsysadmin.com/). This podcast features expert sysadmins covering all manner of topics of interest in their field.

**Books**

[The Practice of Cloud System Administration: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services, Volume 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032194318X) is a comprehensive guide to cloud computing. Using examples from Google, Etsy, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and others, concepts are explained such that practical applications become clear. Major topics include designing modern web and distributed systems, using the latest DevOps/SRE strategies, and evaluating your team’s operational effectiveness.

[The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703). A great read to geek out on, packed with tons of stories about how our modern IT world has come about, including how the first programming language was written by a woman during the 19th century.

[Taming Information Technology: Lessons from Studies of System Administrators](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195374126/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). ""It is essentially an ethnographic study of system administrators. The authors videotaped and otherwise documented SA's over a period of time and were able to break down a number of fascinating incidents and how to improve the art.

As one review says: ""A great read. If you're a Unix sysadmin, like me, you will recognize and empathize with a lot of the concepts. If you've been doing sysadmin work for more than a decade, like myself, then you'll remember the old technologies as described in this book - the modems, the bulletin boards, the days before ""ssh"" ... If you're a new-school sysadmin, then you will be surprised to see a lot of things haven't changed in the world of Unix: telnet is still around, the ""root"" account is still around. The foundations of Unix were laid in the early 1970s. The events of this book took place in the 1980s. And many of the command line tools are still in use today.""

[Time Management for System Administrators: Stop Working Late and Start Working Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-System-Administrators-Working/dp/0596007833). I'm a big fan of time management or more specifically using the time we have to be as effective (not just efficient) as possible. This book had been recommended to the team as it tackles this subject specifically for SysAdmins. 

[The Practice of System and Network Administration: Volume 1: DevOps and other Best Practices for Enterprise IT (3rd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-Enterprise/dp/0321919165). As a recent review puts it ""This book is a crucial library item for any System or Network Administrator regardless of how many years you have under your belt. I picked up the second edition when I first became a sysadmin and it helped me a lot throughout my career. I was very excited when it was announced that this third edition was coming as the second edition has not aged well. The third edition is the perfect, much needed update to the second edition. This new version is definitely now up-to-date and should hopefully give us another decade of service. I definitely recommend this book for the sysadmin in your life or in your office. I always recommend it to my colleagues as it contains valuable information for your career. In fact, buy a few copies because if you loan this book out, I doubt you'll get it back!""

The complex cat-and-mouse game that ensued ultimately inspired permanent changes in the way companies protect their sensitive data.

[Essential System Administration](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596003439) is a practical, comprehensive guide for the Unix sysadmin, covering all the fundamentals required to run AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Tru64, and more. Organized to fit the system administrator's job, it discusses higher-level concepts and the procedural details to carry them out.

8waf8z,sysadmin,1530797214.0,"There has been some posts here recently about Office 365 mailboxes receiving a increase of phishing. Even with bulk filtering set to 1 and all the options enabled they reach the inbox. 

However, if you check the headers of the phishing mails, they are all from other office 365 tenants.

The SPF, DMARC, IP filtering etc are of no use since it's a valid sender. Microsoft doesn't do (any?) filtering on outbound tenant to tenant spam so this is how they are getting through so easily.

It's an Office 365 phishing worm 

1. Hacked Office 365 tenant ""A"" account used to send phish to another Office 365 tenant ""B"". It's always a really obvious phish with Office 365 logos and Microsoft wording but Office 365 filtering lets it past as it trusts email from other Office 365 tenants. 

2. Tenant ""B"" clicks on the link in the phish and enters their credentials. B's credential are added to the database of hacked office 365 accounts.

3. Tenant ""A"" is eventually shut down by Microsoft or the tenant admin changing the users' password but the worm just starts sending again using B's credentials (or any of the probably tens of thousands from the database).

Guys can you sort this dogs dinner of a PC in distribution for me

I came in bright and breezy this morning and switched the offending, antiquated box on – whilst waiting for windows to start loading I packed a couple of despatch items and then turned to look at the screen to be met with the usual message “windows is updating 10&#37;” message

Knowing how slow this computer is I sat back and pondered my life and then began to think about the complexities of space and time. It wasn’t until I had nearly calculated the gravitational pull on an object circulating a wormhole in an elliptical orbit that the message on the screen finally changed.

Much to my distress and consternation however I was met with a new never seen before message “”we couldn’t complete the updates – Undoing changes”. Now given the length of time it took to try and update I realised I could serve my time better by having a cup of tea, so off to the 1st floor for a fresh brew, on returning as expected the message had not changed, we were still undoing – in someways this reversal did make me feel somewhat like Benjamin Button as he actually got younger as time went by in a tortuously long film akin to the length of time  this archaic black box was taking so I decided I would need to shorten my miserable existence on this lonely planet by having a smoke. Now I’m not the fastest smoker of a cigarette in the world and indeed on this occasion I felt no pressure to hurry but even so on my return seeing the same message did crush my dreams and hopes of an early finish for the weekend. I sat down in front of the screen again and hoped, even prayed for a new message or some kind a computer action. My dreams were met shortly afterwards when said PC came up with the reboot message. Enlivened by this I sat up straight expecting to dive back into work with gusto. Unfortunately I received a virtual kick in the nether regions from my black boxed nemesis as it gave me an all too familiar message “we couldn’t complete the updates\- Undoing changes” My life swam around me, memories of the past came flooding back as I relived my time on this earth, the good, the bad, the ugly in a kaleidoscope of images, I summoned my last will of hope and strained every sinew in my body and started to bang my head against the keyboard again and again and again and… well you get the picture. Eventually as we all know, hope springs eternal and some 45 minutes after 1st attempting to do my duty the sign on screen finally appeared, with some trepidation I entered the password and after a further 5 minutes knobs, buttons keys and the mouse sprang into life. My work was done I thought and then I quickly realised it hadn’t even begun yet which hurt, hurt more than you can ever imagine. 

Anyway I’m now over this harrowing part of my life, things are back on track however it’s an experience I’d rather not repeat again so can I implore you all to remove this offending box and replace it with something more youthful and exuberant, much like my former self.

Kind regards

12aqxno,sysadmin,1680542091.0,"Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: ""The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted.""

It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?

Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.

Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.

And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and looking like a goof. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.

So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.

IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.

When things are working, great! ""So, what exactly do you do here again?"" And when things aren't working: ""Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?""

So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12aqxno/the_harder_you_work_the_more_they_will_take_you/,"The harder you work, the more they will take you for granted",,1626,319,0.95

Occasionally we have scheduled work on the weekend that I accommodate, but it's not frequent enough for me to have an issue with it. I happen to know (from a source I won't share) that our executive team is aware that making me an exempt employee would require an additional $16k on my paycheck, therefore I am still hourly. 

Whenever there is the slightest of issues after my regularly scheduled hours, executives will call, text or email me repeatedly. I ignore it because I'm doing school work or sleeping when I'm not working. Unfortunately, every time something comes up and I don't answer, the next day my director talks to me about how we need to plan for ""emergencies"". She wants me to be ""available"" for any after hours issues, however we have 24/7 operations throughout the company. We have a networking consultant that knows our on-premise server stack like the back of his hand. I tell my director each time that he's salaried and should be the first call if anything is critical enough to be contacting me, but their issues are never that critical, they just want someone there to hold their hand. As an example, last night I got a call from our Administration director, to my personal phone (she didn't even call my work phone) to ask why a distribution group she tried to email didn't work. She emailed a group that didn't exist. That's not a critical emergency that warrants calling your IT lead's personal phone while he's sleeping. 

I have a feeling this meeting may come up at any time to discuss after hour availability, and I don't know how else to prepare for it.

Cheers and have a wonderful year!

Update 5/20/20:
There is a new Microsoft offer here: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gnhr4b/fyi_free_microsoft_certification_vouchers/?

Note: this list (below this point) was last edited on 5/6/20 @7pm PST. New content below. 
---------------------------

Oracle (Cloud). These certs all not that useful, but hey, I'll basically take anything when it's free. You can take each exam once. Must complete all tests by 5/15/20. 

Update: I'm not able to see open exam slots for most of these anymore. It's unlikely you will be able to register for an Oracle exam at this point. Seems they’re booked up. 

Free exams available (on Pearson Vue): 

Oracle Autonomous Database Specialist  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Operations Associate  
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Developer Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Professional

More info, and links to register:

All multiple choice exams. 

---------------------------

Juniper Networks. Juniper's ""Open Learning"" program always allows you to earn free associate level exam certs (one time per track; there's 5 tracks). JNCIA-Junos is the hardest to get access to as it requires enrolling in a web course to earn the voucher. 

You can earn the other ones (JNCDA, JNCIA-Cloud, etc) through Junos Genius. You do have to complete the exam within 3 months of earning the free voucher. No rush on this in general though it's been available for a couple years now. Earning a JNCIA cert automatically extends expiration on all other JNCIA Juniper certs you have. So good to space these out over a few years. Multiple choice. Pearson Vue. 

Here's direct links to the Juniper options:

JNCIA-JUNOS: This one requires a special registration session and is capacity controlled. You can sign up for the 10/2020 session here while spaces are still open: https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=10175
All current sessions are full up. Once you register the content will unlock in Junos Genius and you can earn the voucher. You need to use the above link first tho.

6jl0um,sysadmin,1498483150.0,"We have an intern that works for us in the afternoons. He's really cool and we all like him a lot, but had no experience coming in. His job is primarily being an image monkey. We get requests for new computers and he images them and sends them out. He's be going above and beyond the initial responsibilities and has even helped us with some Windows 10 upgrades when we get backed up in the ticket queue.

A few weeks ago I asked him to upgrade a laptop for a sales guy. Not paying attention, he instead did a clean install and wiped all the data. As with many on our sales team, they rarely back up any data or use the means we have in place to secure it, like One Drive.

I informed the sales guy about what happened, he was really cool about it and said he didn't have any data on the hard drive as he used One Drive. Excellent, but I didn't tell the intern this.

Instead I set up a prank, a fun prank to help him remember to be more vigilant about upgrading computers and backing up data. 

I had the intern call the boss who was in on it. The boss told the intern that this sales guy had a huge contract he was working on for a big client and it was the only copy he had. He told the intern to go to the admin team to see about running a program to restore files. He went to the admin team who laid it on heavy. 

""Why didn't you just do an upgrade?""

""You didn't back up his data first?""

""Man that sucks, we probably can't recover it but we can try.""

At this point I started to feel bad for the kid, he looked really defeated. In our software repository I wrote a script and filled a folder with some fake files. The script did a simple read out letting him know we pranked him. He ran the script and I watched him stare at the screen as his brain processed the words, slowly. He dropped his head and started laughing. 

Needless to say, I don't think he'll make the same mistake again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6jl0um/we_pranked_the_intern/,We pranked the intern,Off Topic,1615,225,0.92

You may ask ""why does this matter to IT/sysadmins?"" well. They laid off a large portion of their technology department. The entire help desk is being outsourced to a 3rd party company overseas. The Application Support team was given termination dates as well, if they weren't absorbed into other departments.

I worked there for 3 years, I still have friends that work on that help desk. The mismanagement of the company and the department has always been apparent, and it finally became too much for them to band-aid.

Subway's help desk by the way, is for the 40,000 stores they have worldwide. A fucked up thing is that franchisees would be charged by the minute for support, on their own system. Now they're outsourcing them to a very subpar support staff and (I'm speculating, but almost am certain) they're going to charge franchisees the same amount of money they were charging for U.S. based support, and I can almost guarantee there is no way they're sending out notice of this to the franchisees.

Something I think that's also fucked up is they gave a bunch of people same-day termination dates. This included cafeteria staff for the employee cafeteria, meaning the ""free lunch"" that Subway would brag about providing their employees when they'd take on new hires, was no longer available for them.

Oh, and as a final nail in the coffin, all the help desk/app support were given termination dates in late March/early April, and they were tasked with training the new overseas team before their termination dates approach.

At least this means Subway is probably going under. Fuck that company.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ezsxsd/icymi_subway_headquarters_laid_off_300_people/,"ICYMI - Subway Headquarters laid off 300 people yesterday, including their entire help desk",Career / Job Related,1611,616,0.97
cu0uuj,sysadmin,1566495790.0,"I've been in IT in some way for 25 years now (starting with working in the UNIX lab at my University when I was attending).  Over the years, one gets tired of ""those dumb users"".  We wonder why they do the things they do, or why they don't get certain things.  We hate when they press the wrong button or when they ask us that really dumb question.  Users!

But think about this for a moment.  We are needed.  They can't really function well without us.  We protect them after they have deleted that super important document by restoring it from backups.  We help them when they can't print.  We answer non-IT questions because we seem to simply have a better understanding of how things work.  We keep our companies afloat when the shit hits the fan.  

Yes, it's annoying.  Users are annoying.  But we need them also.  Today, one of my users asked me to restore a folder called ""New Folder"" that was on her Desktop.  At first, I was annoyed because why would something called ""New Folder"" be important to anyone?  How and why did she delete it anyway?  No Recycle Bin?  It turns out that ""New Folder"" contained photos of her mom who recently died.  They were in that folder because she moved them there temporarily until she transferred them to her USB stick.  She thought she transferred the folder, so she deleted it and emptied the Recycle Bin because we don't really allow personal photos on our computers.  When she went to check, she realized that she never copied it in the first place.  Thankfully, today was one of the few days recently when I fixed a problem without grumbling internally or giving some short answer to the user.  When she called, I asked where the folder was, and I restored it.  When I let her know that the folder was restored, I guess I had a happy voice.  She commented that I didn't make her feel bad; she was afraid to call in the first place, but I made her day and I wasn't an asshole about it.  


I'm going to be nicer to my users, even if I have to pretend to be happy and not annoyed.  Who is with me?

cw3jc6,sysadmin,1566907738.0,"Hi [r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin),

It's been 6 months since we launched the full list on our website. We decided to celebrate with a mega list of the items we've featured since then, broken down by category. Enjoy!

To make sure I'm following the rules of rsysadmin, rather than link directly to our website for sign up for the weekly email I'm experimenting with reddit ads so:

You can sign up to get this in your inbox each week (with extras) by [following this link](https://www.reddit.com/comments/cnzvpy/11000_upvotes_from_rsysadmin_and_counting_it_pro/).

\*\* We're looking for tips from IT Pros, SysAdmins and MSPs in IT Pro Tuesday. This could be command line, shortcuts, process, security or whatever else makes you more effective at doing your job. **Please leave a comment with your favorite tip(s), and we'll feature them over the following weeks.**

Now on with the tools... As always, EveryCloud has no known affiliation with any of these unless we explicitly state otherwise.

**Free Tools**

[Pageant](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is an SSH authentication agent that makes it easier to connect to Unix or Linux machines via PuTTY. Appreciated by plazman30 who says, ""It took me WAY TOO LONG to discover this one. Pageant is a component of Putty. It sits in your system tray and will let you load SSH keys into it and pass them through to putty, WinSCP, and number of other apps that support it.""

[NCurses Disk Usage](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is fast, simple and easy and should run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed. Recommended by durgadas as ""something I install on all my Linuxes... Makes finding out sizes semi-graphical, \[with\] super easy nav. Good for places without monitoring—lightweight and fast; works on nearly all flavors of Unix I've needed.""

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is an open-source scripting language for Windows that helps you easily create small to complex scripts for all sorts of tasks (form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc.) Automate any desktop task with this small, fast tool that runs out-of-the-box. Recommended by plazman30 as a ""pretty robust Windows scripting language. I use it mostly for on-the-fly pattern substitution. It's nice to be able to type 'bl1' and have it auto-replace it my bridge line phone number.""

[PingInfoView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/multiple_ping_tool.html) lets you easily ping multiple host names and IP addresses, with the results compiled in a single table. Automatically pings all hosts at the interval you specify, and displays the number of successful and failed pings, as well as average ping time. Results can be saved as a text/html/xml file or copied to the clipboard. Thanks go to sliced\_BR3AD for this one.

[DriveDroid](https://www.drivedroid.io/) simulates a USB thumbdrive or CD-drive via the mass storage capabilities in the Android/Linux kernel. Any ISO/IMG files on the phone can be exposed to a PC, as well as any other USB thumbdrive capabilities, including booting from the drive. Can be a quick and easy option for OS installations, rescues or occasions when it helps to have a portable OS handy. Suggested by codywarmbo, who likes it because of the ability to ""Boot a PC using ISO files stored on your Android phone... Having a 256GB SD full of any OS you want is super handy!""

[FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page) is an integrated identity and authentication solution for Linux/UNIX networked environments. It combines Linux (Fedora), 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP, DNS and Dogtag (Certificate System). Provides centralized authentication, authorization and account information by storing data about user, groups, hosts and other objects necessary to manage the security of a network. Thanks to skarsol, who recommends it as an open-source solution for cross-system, cross-platform, multi-user authentication.

[PCmover Profile Migrator](http://ppm.laplink.com/) migrates applications, files and settings between any two user profiles on the same computer to help set up PCs with O365 Business. User profile apps, data and settings are quickly and easily transferred from the old local AD users to new Azure AD users. Can be good for migrating data from a user profile associated with a former domain to a new profile on a new domain. Suggested by a\_pojke, who found it useful ""to help migrate profiles to 0365/AAD; it's been a life saver with some recent onboards."" 

[GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) is a Linux package manager that is based on the Nix package manager, with Guile Scheme APIs. It is an advanced distribution of the GNU OS that specializes in providing exclusively free software. Supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management and more. When used as a standalone distribution, Guix supports declarative system configuration for transparent and reproducible operating systems. Comes with thousands of packages, which include applications, system tools, documentation, fonts and more. Recommended by necrophcodr.

[Attack Surface Analyzer 2.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer) is the latest version of the MS tool for taking a snapshot of your system state before and after installation of software. It displays changes to key elements of the system attack surface so you can view changes resulting from the introduction of the new code. This updated version is a rewrite of the classic 1.0 version from 2012, which covered older versions of Windows. It is available for download or as source code on Github. Credit for alerting us to this one goes to Kent Chen.

[Process Hacker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/processhacker/) is an open-source process viewer that can help with debugging, malware detection, analyzing software and system monitoring. Features include: a clear overview of running processes and resource usage, detailed system information and graphs, viewing and editing services and more. Recommended by k3nnyfr, who likes it as a ""ProcessExplorer alternative, good for debugging SRP and AppLocker issues.""

[Q-Dir](https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/q-dir-portable) (the Quad Explorer) provides quick, simple access to hard disks, network folders, USB-sticks, floppy disks and other storage devices. Includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, and the correct one is used automatically. This tool has found a fan in user\_none, who raves, ""Q-Dir is awesome! I searched high and low for a good, multi-pane Explorer replacement that didn't have a whole bunch of junk, and Q-Dir is it. Fantastic bit of software.""

[iftop](http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/) is a command-line system monitor tool that lets you display bandwidth usage on an interface. It produces a frequently updated list of network connections, ordered according to bandwidth usage—which can help in identifying the cause of some network slowdowns. Appreciated by zorinlynx, who likes that it ""\[l\]ets you watch a network interface and see the largest flows. Good way to find out what's using up all your bandwidth.""

[Delprof2](https://helgeklein.com/free-tools/delprof2-user-profile-deletion-tool/) is a command-line-based application for deleting user profiles in a local or remote Windows computer according to the criteria you set. Designed to be easy to use with even very basic command-line skills. This one is thanks to Evelen1, who says, ""I use this when computers have problems due to profiles taking up all the hard drive space.""

[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) is a Windows software distribution and building platform. This independent rewrite of MSYS, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64, aims for better interoperability with native Windows software. It includes a bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and more for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains. The package management system provides easy installation. Thanks for this one go to Anonymouspock, who says, ""It's a mingw environment with the Arch Linux pacman package manager. I use it for ssh'ing into things, which it does very well since it has a proper VT220 compatible terminal with an excellent developer.""

[FastCopy](https://fastcopy.jp/en/) is the fastest copy/backup software for Windows. Supports UNICODE and over MAX\_PATH (260 characters) file pathnames. Uses multi-threads to bring out the best speed of devices and doesn't hog resources, because MFC is not used. Recommended by DoTheEvolution as the ""fastest, comfiest copy I ever used. \[I\]t behaves just like I want, won't shit itself on trying to read damaged hdd, long paths are no problem, logs stuff, can shutdown after done, got it integrated into portable totalcommander.""

[Baby Web Server](http://www.pablosoftwaresolutions.com/html/baby_web_server.html) is an alternative for Microsoft's IIS. This simple web server offers support for ASP, with extremely simple setup. The server is multi threaded, features a real-time server log and allows you to configure a directory for webpages and default HTML page. Offers support for GET, POST and HEAD methods (form processing); sends directory listing if default HTML is not found in directory; native ASP, cookie and SSI support; and statistics on total connections, successful and failed requests and more. Limited to 5 simultaneous connections. FatherPrax tells us it's ""\[g\]reat for when you're having to update esoteric firmware at client sites.""

[Bping](http://gizmoware.net/bping/) is a Windows ping alternative that beeps whenever a reply comes in. Can allow you to keep track of your pings without having to watch the monitor. According to the recommendation from bcahill, ""you can set it to beep on ping reply or on ping failure (default). I love it because if I'm wanting to monitor when a server goes up or down, I can leave it running in the background and I'll know the instant the status changes.""

[LDAPExplorerTool](http://ldaptool.sourceforge.net/) is a multi-platform graphical LDAP browser and tool for browsing, modifying and managing LDAP servers. Tested for Windows and Linux (Debian, Red Hat, Mandriva). Features SSL/TLS & full UNICODE support, the ability to create/edit/remove LDAP objects and multivalue support (including edition). Endorsed by TotallyNotIT... ""Holy hell, that thing is useful.""

[MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) is a tool that lists the MX records for a domain in priority order. Changes to MX Records show up instantly because the MX lookup is done directly against the domain's authoritative name server. Diagnostics connects to the mail server, verifies reverse DNS records, performs a simple Open Relay check and measures response time performance.

I had already bought up 20 laptops in case we had to quarantine people, but i had to buy 20 laptops more to make sure that everyone can work from home. We already have 30 people that have laptops, so from monday and tuesday we will have 70 VPN users instead of normally 1-5 people on a regular day.

My plan: Everyone has remote desktop access to their workstation at the office, turned on the machines and made sure they don't go to sleep. 

Created documentation so everyone knows how to get on to their own machine.

I figured it would be the least taxing on our conncetion to make everyone work on remote desktop on their machine at work.

I changed our VPN setup so that, we are using split tunnelling on the VPN client to reduce load, from those of them who is working directly from their laptop and not on the remote desktop so that office365, spotify whatever is going through their own connection and not over our router.

I am hoping that our ASA 5508 can handle the 50-70 VPN users, on a 500/500 mbit connection, time will tell.

Pray for me monday!

I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.

&#x200B;

Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how ""all IT people"" tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.

&#x200B;

To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.

&#x200B;

Really?

&#x200B;

Am I supposed to get 'ready for work' on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre != TV) nor interest?

&#x200B;

Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because ""you work in IT"".

&#x200B;

I am totally sick of it. Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?

v9d4t7,sysadmin,1654882674.0,"Disclaimer: After the initial poking around the network and looking at a few invoices, I withdrew from any other involvement in the issue. Not my circus, not my monkeys.

TLDR: Both the accountant and the IT guy were fired this morning after they arrived at the office. The accountant was mainly fired for reasons outside of this specific incident.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/v7ptaq/an\_interesting\_it\_sidehustle\_dont\_actually\_try/

My friend called me this morning to fill me in on everything that has happened since last Saturday. After I left, he called the owner and explained what had been found. The owner came into the office and together they went through a mountain of eBay invoices. It turns out that the company had been buying parts for some of their old manufacturing systems, conveyor systems, etc.… from eBay as there wasn’t any other means to acquire parts for the outdated equipment on the factory floor. A little over 6 years ago the first invoice from the one specific seller in question appeared, selling them a used part for one of their machines for a whopping $15k. For the first 2 years it was only this type of stuff being purchased from the eBay seller, but over time more and more stuff was being purchased through this single seller including office furniture, office supplies, and IT equipment. In 2019, nearly $200k was spent on buying product from this seller. The owner was certain that the electrician/IT guy was behind the eBay account and didn’t want to set up a sting. Instead, he wanted to give the guy the opportunity to confess to running the hustle. Apparently, the owner and the IT guy are long time acquaintances and possibly even go to the same church. This morning when the accountant and IT guy arrived at the office they were ushered into separate rooms for questioning.

IT guy: He quickly admitted that the eBay account was his. When he was asked if the IT equipment was all new, he said it was. He bought it all online from Amazon, CDW, TigerDirect, or other sources, depending on who had the cheapest price. As far as the parts for the manufacturing systems, he bought those off of eBay and then resold them to the company. He didn’t want to say how much he marked the stuff up. He was questioned about whether the accountant knew what he was doing and he said that the accountant did not. After the interview he was formally fired and escorted out of the building.

Accountant: He denied knowledge of the hustle and stated that he had never noticed that everything was coming from one single eBay seller. In the end he was fired for gross negligence on a variety of issues. One other specific issue was he continued processing payroll for a terminated employee for 6 weeks after the termination date. He stated that he didn’t know the employee had been terminated. After it was proven that the manager had indeed sent an email informing the accountant of the termination, the accountant replied “Yea, but that manager is an asshole. I don’t open emails from him”.

Other info: The owner is not interested in pressing the issue any further. The owner is older and has been phasing himself out of the day-to-day operations which is why he hired my friend as the controller. Before that, the owner had been fulfilling those duties. He had been planning to fire the accountant anyway after the company was in a better position to replace him, but this issue sped up the process. As far as the network, apparently an MSP had set up and configured AD, Office 365, MFA, and SharePoint. The IT guy only maintained the setup. However, I’m still going to give mad props to the guy for not punching large security holes in the configuration. He could have set up Local Administrator on PCs, forwarded RDP through the firewall, but he didn’t do any of that. Because of this I am still going to say he is somewhat of a unicorn, or at least a leprechaun.

My personal thoughts: Most of these hustles get uncovered when the hustler gets greedy and goes for the big score but this was kind of the opposite. The IT guy had the big score with the machine parts which probably had massive margin. I doubt anyone would have been suspicious if all those parts were coming from a single seller as they would just think it was some other manufacturer liquidating their old equipment. Instead, he added in a bunch of small stuff that had minimal margin and that’s what made it suspicious. Also, I just have to say that with a disengaged owner and a lazy accountant, this almost feels like entrapment. /sarcasmbutnotreally",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/v9d4t7/update_an_interesting_it_sidehustle_dont_actually/,UPDATE: An interesting IT sidehustle (don’t actually try this),,1594,324,0.97
ft8zmo,sysadmin,1585776238.0,"Hello all, longtime lurker, first time poster.

Today I found the reason I'm going to be quitting my current job. My bosses boss, let's call him Rick, finally made me realize he does not value me or anyone around me. 

I've been thinking about moving on from my current position as it's severely underpaid and overworked for a ""desktop support technician"" role (I manage parts of our vcenter, MDT deployments, guide our student workers, create all the documentation and handouts, and of course everything and anything related to the help desk and user support along with anything else I'm probably forgetting).

As many of you may know by now, the world is kind of in pandemic mode. Social distancing and quarantine are parts of life everywhere, expect for my office. A few weeks ago when our university campus moved everyone to WFH, Rick deemed our entire user support department ""essential"" so we're operating like business is usual. My direct boss has argued with Rick over the last few weeks and managed to get everyone except for myself, himself, and one of our part-time technicians to work from home. That leaves about half of our department still needing to show up daily while the other half has the choice to work from home. We are required to phone in to our public safety department in order to be granted access to the building every morning and required to check out with them every day at 5.

Anyways, to the fun part. My boss is out today and yesterday as he's sick with another highly contagious thing that's not the COVID. It was a fairly normal day, involving a few remote calls and sessions with users to show them how to use their at-home technology and such. A little after noon the president of our university calls Rick and lets him know they want to be able to print from home. They apparently purchased a new printer and wants it to be set up and doesn't know what to do.

This is when Rick visits me and asks if I know anything about their home wireless network. Apparently one of our technicians (he forgot who) set it up for her a few years ago and was wondering if it was me. I told him that I had never been to their house and didn't know where they even lived. He called around the other technicians and found out the technician that helped set it up had left shortly after doing that. So he comes back to me and tells me to go to her house and help her set the printer up. 

I go there thinking it'd be simple enough, just unbox this thing and connect it to the network (and hope everything works). Turns out, they've had the printer and it's ""like brand new"" because they haven't ever used it in the years since it's been purchased. So I turn it on and voila, it's already connected and connected to their university device. That should be it, right?

Wrong, since it's been just sitting there for years, the cartridges dried out. I check the cartridges and their expiration date reads September 2017. This printer has been sitting around unused for over two and a half years and now they want it to work. I tell them I'll let Rick know that we'll need to get new cartridges and left. Out in my car I text Rick and my boss the info and he texts back that I need to go to the store and find these cartridges.

So I go to the store he suggested and walk in. I run over to the printer cartridge isle and find the two that's needed. This is when it finally hits me - Rick doesn't care about me. I'm coming to work every day during a global quarantine in an office with someone that just literally got strep throat. I was  just told to go visit the president of our university at their home because they can't figure out the printer they bought over 2 years ago. Now I'm in a store and expected to spend $50 of my own money to buy two cartridges and run back to their house.

I texted Rick and my boss that I can't spare the money, I just paid rent and a lot of money towards my student loans (which I did, that isn't a lie), and I can't afford to spend $50 right now. 

So now it's a little after 5, I am home and just updated my resume and posted it online. I don't expect to hear from any company any time soon with everything going on, but I finally realized today I want to jump ship from this crapshow.

Disclaimer: I obviously side with the many many many comments about this being a big security risk so normally, this isn't advised. We made the switch last night and moved this applications to a virtualized environment and exposing only those apps to users. It's better security wise but I still will try to push for a move towards a more modern, better, more secure standard like HTML5.

I've been working for my current employer for 24 years. It's been a good run. We are a small outfit, I came on board when we had 5 people. We are a publishing-ish outfit, creating employee newsletters for big companies. I've done it all here since right out of high school. Got us into the laptop world in the late 90s, set up our first dialup Internet, was a part of growth over the years to a high of about 60 people. 

I wore almost every hat in the company. I did the production side of things and have been a sole sysadmin the entire time too. It wasn't uncommon for me to be in a hotel room somewhere and connecting back to the office to fix or maintain a server. Or set up remote workers with disabilities. Or fix a roof leak. Or change oil on a company car. Or swap out a failing logic board on someone's machine. Very much a jack-of-all-trades. And I loved it for the most part. I got to design all of our infrastructure, decide what to buy, create it all myself the way I wanted it to be and the way it fit us best.

I'm also 2nd in seniority behind the owner. I hate managing people. I suck at it. I have absolutely zero interest in running the business. And our owner, who truly is a great guy, is in his 70s and won't be around forever. I desperately don't want to be the one who gets a 2 a.m. phone call from an emergency room with bad news and suddenly I'm ""the guy"" running the company.

But, we lost some huge contracts a few years ago. I can't remember the last time I had a raise. Our equipment is old (all 2012-model MacBook Pros). Money is perpetually tight. We lost our health insurance because it wasn't sustainable. We are down to about 16 people. I'm always on call whether it is ""I'm in a hotel and can't connect to the server"" or ""I'm in the middle of nowhere with a flat tire."" I'm literally bored half the time because there isn't much to do. We lease our building now and don't own it meaning I don't get to do any facility stuff which I loved doing when we owned places in the past. I love hands-on work.

Most of our clients are major railroads. And I grew up in the railroad industry. Dad was a freight car repair person, fourth generation. My grandfather's grandfather worked laying some of the first railroad track in central Minnesota in the late 1800s. So I know the industry, I've worked in it at my current employer.

I went for it. Applied at a railroad that is also one of our clients. [And they took me](https://imgur.com/a/ZQ1o0Jr). In a few weeks I'll be starting in a locomotive maintenance/repair shop as a pipefitter/sheetmetal worker. Working with my hands! Welding, cutting, metalwork. Work that is solid and secure (well, compared to where I was at). Better pay. Great health insurance. Railroad retirement. Company paid training. I'm so eager and giddy like I never have been before!

Not burning bridges though. I'll stick around a little on-call where I'm at. I don't want to leave them hanging, and like I said, I designed everything here and no one else really has a grasp of it. But it'll be on my time and at my discretion.

Microsoft first notified us of this patch in the MARCH updates. That means two months and three updates ago.

What, do you not want Microsoft to fix critical security vulnerabilities??? That's their job! And they gave you so much lead time on this one...

First of all, you should be reading the patch notes every single month. What self-respecting sys admin deployes updates every month without seeing what is patched? What if they are fixing something that will affect your organization? Like this month!

You go ahead and install Microsoft's updates with blind trust every month because you are too lazy to read the resources they give you, and then complain that you can't trust Microsoft despite the fact that they told you this was coming...

Secondly, if you are saying you can't control which Windows updates are deployed, then you better figure out something quick! WSUS, and desktop control application like Labtech or ManageEngine. The truth is, sometimes Microsoft does break things, although this was not the case this time. If you had a system in place for deploying updates this would not have happened since you would never have whitelisted it until you had your servers patched.

Need an easier solution? How about a GPO that searches for updates only a couple of weeks after patch Tuesday? Get creative! And read the patch notes before then!

Start actually managing your environment. Treat it as your own. If this affected your company, then it is your IT teams fault and no one else's. Take ownership, learn from your mistakes, and just don't let it happen again!

TL;DR - You had two months notice on this ""RDP breaking Windows update"". Step up and do your job properly by reading patch notes. Stop blaming Microsoft. Be a Sys Admin.

Edit 2: Thanks for the second gold! I now feel obligated to give some sort of general response to the hate.

1) This rant is not pro Microsoft, let me make that clear. All I am saying is that this time around MS did what they should have. 2 months notice, staged rollout, spread over 3 updates, and even provided a GPO fix for companies not ready. So in this instance, I'm frustrated at people blaming them for what they should have handled.

2) A lot of responses about being overworked and not having bandwidth. Fair point, that doesn't make you bad at your job. My apologies to those people specifically. Perhaps a better title would have been ""not doing their jobs"". That is factually accurate, because whether you like it or not, it is our jobs as sys admins to vet and deploy updates. With all the recent problems MS has been having, you should be even more cautious! If the company you work for refuses to give you the resources you need to do your job effectively, then it's time to look for a new job. That includes staffing, deployment tools, etc. Because at the end of the day, you're the one that gets blamed.

fnuv2b,sysadmin,1585007731.0,"Hey folks, 

Your [favorite ex-sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/etc9h4/today_is_my_last_day_as_a_sysadmin/) is back again. I've been asked about my ""Security if a feature we do not support"" flair a few times. After reading /u/thefutureisnotset's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fnnfp5/boss_let_a_hacker_in/), I thought it was time to share the story.

I used to work for Seagate. (Normally I don't name my former employers. But for reasons that will become apparent, this is the ""fuck you"" exception to that rule). My boss at the time was a director who was utterly, grossly incompetent. She also had an extremely grating personality, and annoyed the hell out of everyone who had to interact with her. (I could go on. I have enough to say about her that it could be its own rant) 

We were shipping a product with a Linux distro that was half-a-decade old and had thousands of known vulnerabilities. We were not shipping any upstream security patches for it. I tried everything to change that, but my boss repeatedly, purposefully prevented me from doing it. I finally confronted her, and she told me ""Opheltes, security is a feature we do not support."" I was, as you can imagine, stunned. It was, of course, a bullshit non-policy that she made up on the spot, but it was indicative of the general lax attitude towards security.  

Following that comment, I was sorely tempted to close all of our customer facing tickets with a message that ""<boss's name> says security is a feature we do not support. Closing this as won't fix."" (That would have changed the policy but almost certainly would have resulted in me getting fired.)

I left the company after they announced the closure of our local office and tried to get me to move across country with a shitty relocation package. Instead, I jumped ship quickly. After I put in my two weeks notice, my boss actually had the temerity to ask me to stay a third week for ""knowledge transfer"", which actually meant scrubbing the hell out of tickets. I flatly told her no. She got pink slipped 6 months later, moved to our competitor, got fired after 6 months (presumably for gross incompetence), and has been unemployed for several years.  

A year later, I got a letter in the mail. It was a data breach notification. Apparently the lax attitude towards security extended all the way to the CEO's office. Someone had socially engineered the CEO's secretary into sending out a spreadsheet containing every employee's SSN number. Everyone in the company was compromised. Someone filed fraudulent tax returns for me and tons of my co-workers. I spent 10-20 hours dealing with the fallout. There was later a class action lawsuit, but (as you can imagine) the workers who were shafted never saw much out of it.

Over the past few years, I've been having health issues. Occasional migraines which I dismissed. I assumed it was from looking at a screen all day long. Occasional sinus infections I ignored because everyone gets these, right? Occasional nosebleeds that HAD to be because of the dry climate I'm working in. Over the last few months, these symptoms have gotten progressively worse. My nosebleeds were happening frequently enough that I would keep pieces of tampons in my desk (I'm a male BTW) to shove them up my nose so I could continue working through them.

Today, I finally went to the doctor. When the diagnosis came in, I can't say I'm surprised. The symptoms had been there for years. Ironically, I now work in the medical field and run into this thing all the time. I've seen this happen to hundreds of people over the years. I just never thought it would happen to me. I have surgery scheduled for next week. Wish me luck. On the bright side, I finally know what was causing my symptoms. In a weeks time, I should finally be free from my deviated nasal septum. I should have figured it out a lot earlier to be honest. It's always DNS.

EDIT: Because I've been getting a few PMs: Yes. I do have to have surgery for my deviated septum. I tried telling this joke to my current coworkers, but it fell on deaf ears. I figured you would enjoy it.

When dealing with vendors, partners, etc. remember that there are two elements to business: businesses connecting for mutual benefit, and the plain human interactions that come with that. 

Personal kindness goes a long way. The guy on the other end of the phone, unless proven otherwise, is just going to a job and doing his best too. Some people are maliciously incompetent but it is rare. Wait until you’re certain of that to get mad at someone else over work that doesn’t affect either of you once you’re home. 

We had a partner miss a deadline that dinged our bottom line to the tune of $300 per month for the next 3 years. Notable but a drop in the bucket. It was simply a miss on getting in on a New Year deal with a vendor because they underestimated how difficult some of the paperwork would be.  

I could tell the rep calling me to say that was really frustrated and disappointed. My response was simply:

“We’ve missed bigger opportunities before brother. Things happen. It wasn’t all you so don’t take on all of the worry. Happy Friday and enjoy your weekend.”

I don’t open work email on weekends, so I just got to work and saw that he emailed me Saturday afternoon to tell me how much he appreciated my words and that I saved his weekend with his family by reminding him about his priorities. 

Really hit home for me. I always try to be kind to others because I don't love work and assume most people don't either. Never had someone so directly thank me for it.

at18wi,sysadmin,1550741630.0,"I first met this guy when one of our suppliers called me in a panic because their server had died. 1 of the 3 disks in a RAID5 array had failed, a 2nd was well on it's way out. I wasn't there in a professional capacity, I wouldn't call them friends but we're friendly. I started trying to recover whatever data I could, because no-one seemed clear about the status of backups. I left to fetch a spare drive and when I got back, their IT guy was there, not happy about my presence and preparing to wipe the server. I asked about the backups, they had a 1TB OneDrive account... which they'd stopped using 6 months before for reasons which remain unclear. They had another 100GB cloud backup, for which no-one knew the encryption key, and ~450GB of data in total. At some point, he just disappeared, and when the customer called him, he said if I was involved, he wouldn't be. I wasn't in a position to deal with their IT, so I gave him the drive containing their data and left him to it. It was reasonably amicable.

A few months later he called me because one of his clients had a problem with their server that he couldn't solve. I agreed to have a look, when I got there it was an IBM server running RHEL, which hadn't been updated since 2007. It had been infected with a virus, and whenever they connected it to the network, their internet completely died presumably because the server was trying to DOS someone. Again, the status of the backup was totally unclear, there was a backup drive with a bent plug permanently connected but no-one had a clue if it worked. During my visit, the IT guy told me that he'd been trying to forward a port to the server for remote access **'but it didn't work so I opened all the ports instead, then it worked'**

I regret this, but I managed to get them back online by disabling the default gateway on the server and told them in no uncertain terms that this was a temporary solution and that they really needed to fix it properly. I sent a quote for 2 days work at a very reasonable rate to stand up a temporary server, test the backup, transfer data and wipe and restore the old server.

He never responded.

I sent a follow up mail to say 'bring me a backup drive and I'll see if it actually contains any data, for free'

He never responded.

So I let it go, not my circus, not my monkeys.

Then, yesterday, I got an email from the supplier from the top of this post. Being a curious person, I ran an nmap against their IP.

    Host is up (0.031s latency).
    Not shown: 988 closed ports

    3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server

That's a Windows server... directly on the internet. I called the guy and went round immediately to find that he's done exactly the same thing, he'd tried to forward port 3389, failed because he put the internal IP address where it says 'Authorized external IP' so then, **he put the server in the DMZ**

His lack of understanding worries me deeply, and I really really want to go round to the guys whose Linux server he destroyed and recommend they find a new IT guy. But... It's really not my problem, and I don't want to make it my problem.

Bad security. I'm curious if it were just underfunded administrators, lack of caring or what caused this breach.



>The credit agency failed to patch a disclosed vulnerability in Apache Struts, a common open source web server, which Homeland Security had issued a warning about some months before. The unpatched Apache Struts server was powering its five-decades-old(!) web-facing system that allowed consumers to check their credit rating from the company’s website. The attackers used the vulnerability to pop a web shell on the server weeks later, and managed to retain access for more than two months, the House panel found, and were able to pivot through the company’s various systems by obtaining an unencrypted file of passwords on one server, letting the hackers access more than 48 databases containing unencrypted consumer credit data.


>“Equifax did not see the data exfiltration because the device used to monitor [the vulnerable server’s] network traffic had been inactive for 19 months **due to an expired security certificate**,” the report said. It took another two months for Equifax to update the expired certificate, at which point staff “immediately noticed suspicious web traffic.” Even Equifax’s own former chief information officer David Webb — who also “retired” following the incident — told House investigators that the whole incident could have been prevented had the company updated the vulnerable Struts system within two days of the patch’s release.

Today he called me back on my direct line, and spend another 20 minutes with me walking him through some business specific software we use. We had a pleasant talk that branched out to various non-IT subjects, before he finally got through to the reports he wanted, and we ended the call.

Since there's a soft-paywall:

> Remember when Microsoft's disastrous Windows 10 October Update removed entire user folders like documents and photos? Or the Surface Book 2 owners who had their systems rendered useless from update KB4467682? This happened because users were manually checking for updates and not waiting for the update to get automatically triggered. Why is this a big deal? Because the average Windows user believes that's a safe way to get their system updates as soon as possible. Unfortunately, it's the exact opposite, and Microsoft's Corporate President for Windows has admitted it in a recent blog post.

> First a brief explainer on the release cadence of Windows Updates. Each month Microsoft releases three batches of updates. The second Tuesday of each month (also known as ""Patch Tuesday"") is a quality update that includes security and non-security fixes. Microsoft labels these as ""B"" releases.

> However, Microsoft also issues optional updates during the third and fourth weeks of each month. These are known as ""C"" and ""D"" releases. Here's Michael Fortin, Corporate Vice President, Windows, to explain those for you:

>> ""These are preview releases, primarily for commercial customers and advanced users “seeking” updates.  These updates have only non-security fixes. The intent of these releases is to provide visibility into, and enable testing of, the non-security fixes that will be included in the next Update Tuesday release. Advanced users can access the “C” and “D” releases by navigating to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and clicking the “Check for updates” box.""

> Wait, what?

> I wonder how many of the 700 million Windows 10 users don't realize they are potential ""seekers,"" which effectively translates to beta-testers. Certainly those folks who tried to get the latest updates for their PCs by manually initiating  the process, only to have documents wiped out of existence or flagship Microsoft laptops broken didn't realize it.

> This doesn't mean these updates are completely untested. Quite the opposite. But they've proven to be repeatedly problematic.

> As Chris Hoffman at How-To Geek points out, ""at the very least, Microsoft needs to provide a warning before Windows 10 users click the 'Check for updates' button. Don’t warn people in blog posts that only advanced users will read."" This option simply shouldn't exist unless users go through a carefully-worded opt-in procedure for these ""C"" and ""D"" updates, complete with explicit warnings.

roja89,sysadmin,1640472560.0,"I've been in the job market recently and for a while it's been difficult to find traction on jobs that truly interest me and seem like a good fit for me.

I would apply, get through the interview process but ultimately they decide to go with another candidate. Well, I pressed one of the companies on why I wasn't picked, and they mentioned that I had a lot of experience (about 10 years) and I did well on all the interviews, but they were looking for a more mid-level candidate that could ""train up"".

""Huh"", I thought. The next day I deleted my oldest two jobs on my resume, roughly reducing my experience to 4 years. I intentionally deleted certain programming languages I worked with, I removed certifications I had attained, and generally created a resume of someone with 3-4 years of experience. 

To be clear, I didn't falsify anything. I just omitted the extent of my work.

Well, it worked. I got several more interviews out of the new resume and ultimately decided to land a job with one of them. The pay was actually damn near what I would have made in a role with a 9-10 year experience (fortune 500 company).

It sucks, but it goes back to the age old maxim of supply vs demand. There aren't a lot of jobs that specifically look for 10+ years of experience, but there are plenty, plenty more to choose from if you lower it to 3-5 years experience. 

I don't know what it is about having more experience that scares away recruiters. Maybe they think you're using the job as a stepping stone, or an interim gig for something better, but I am convinced that brandishing experience has a deleterious effect if you're casting a wide net for a job. I'd rather have my pick of 10 different jobs than 2 really good ones that are really hard to attain.

If you think that working in supercomputing where most of my users have PhDs—often in a field of computing—means that they can all follow basic instructions on computer use, think again.      

When that happens I try to remember a 2016 study I found by OECD^[1](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED567018) on basic computer literacy throughout 33 (largely wealthy) countries. The study asked 16 to 65 year olds to perform computer-based tasks requiring varying levels of skill and graded them on completion.         

Here's a summary of the tasks at different skill levels^[2](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4b75m4tj):       

- Level 1: Sort emails into pre-existing folders based on who can and who cannot attend a party.

- Level 2: Locate relevant information in a spreadsheet and email it to the person who requested it.

- Level 3: Schedule a new meeting in a meeting planner where availability conflicts exist, cancel conflicting meeting times, and email the relevant people to update them about it.

So how do you think folks did? It's probably worse than you imagined.

10% | Had no computer skills (not tested)
5.4% | Failed basic skills test of using a mouse and scrolling through a webpage (not tested)
9.6% | Opted out (not tested)

vqcf67,sysadmin,1656834663.0,"Howdy, folks! Happy Fourth of July weekend. 

This is a weird one -- did you know that Windows has an ""emergency restart"" button? I certainly didn't until a few hours ago. As far as I can tell, it's completely undocumented, but if you press CTRL+ALT+DEL, then Ctrl-click the power button in the bottom right, you'll be greeted by a prompt that says the following: 

**Emergency restart**  
Click OK to immediately restart. Any unsaved data will be lost. Use this only as a last resort.  
\[  OK   \]  \[  CANCEL  \]

Now, I wouldn't consider this to be remarkable -- Ctrl+Alt+Del is the ""panic screen"" for most people, after all, it makes sense to have something like this there -- but what baffles me is just how quickly it works. This is, by far, the fastest way to shut down a Windows computer other than pulling the power cord. There is no splash text that says ""Restarting..."", no waiting, nothing. As soon as you hit ""OK"", the loading spinner runs for a brief moment, and the system is completely powered off within three seconds. I encourage you to try it on your own machine or in a VM (with anything important closed, of course).

I wanted to share this with the people in this subreddit because A) this is a neat debugging/diagnostic function to know for those rare instances where Task Manager freezes, and B) I'm very curious as to how it works. I checked the Windows Event Log and at least to the operating system, the shutdown registers as ""unexpected"" (dirty) which leads me to believe this is some sort of internal kill-the-kernel-NOW functionality. After a bit of testing with `Restart-Computer` and `shutdown /r /f`, I've found that no officially-documented shutdown command or function comes close in speed -- they both take a fair bit of time to work, and importantly, they both register in the Event Log as a clean shutdown. So what's going on here?

I'm interested in trying to figure out what command or operation the system is running behind the scenes to make this reboot happen so rapidly; as far as I can tell, the only way to invoke it is through the obscure UI. I can think of a few use cases where being able to use this function from the command line would be helpful, even if it causes data loss, as a last resort.

Long day. He had to leave at 6PM, and by 9PM I was pretty exhausted but glad that everything was working and it was time to go home. We had to be in early to help all of the users get logged in and situated. For giggles I rebooted the server to make sure all was well. It wasn't. It was bad. Some programs wouldn't launch and the server had no internet connection, workstations couldn't connect to the server.  All kinds of bizarre things were going on. 

Since we were an MSP I had a Microsoft Support get out of jail free card. I called, we tried different things. The details are fuzzy, but we tried to repair TCP/IP, repair install, and a host of other things. In the end it was determined that I need to reload the operating system -- and AD, DNS, DHCP, Exchange, etc. I now had to work all night and hopefully be done by the time the users came in the next morning.

I put the DVD in and started the install. By chance, around 11PM a senior coworker called to check on me. I explained my predicament. He casually asked, ""Did you uncheck IPV6."" Yes, I had (I was a new tech and thought it was unnecessary). He replied, ""Check it back, reboot, and go home."" I checked it, rebooted, and a minute later everything was working normally.

Setting- Newerish office building in another state a good 200 miles from HQ and most of the corporate IT staff of a very large company.  Frequent massive, building wide network outages.  Routers go crazy, switches hang, servers regardless of OS or hardware throw spurious network related issues.  The issues are random, and happen a few times a month.   Problem goes on for over a year.    Numerous staff sent down to troubleshoot issue with no obvious fault, but it takes countless visits before the situation is finally witnessed by somebody other than the local Sysadmin.   The final IT witness from HQ starts to question the motives of the local Sysadmin , upper mgmt gets involved,  local Sysadmin is threatened with discipline but finally resigned in frustration as they saw it was a no-win situation.     Sr Level contractor brought in to audit everything, nothing odd found, problem happens again about 2 weeks after original sysadmin left.   

  A small group of Sr people are discussing this problem at a local conference with peers (using alias' of course) and somebody makes a joke about EMP - electro magnetic pulse, usually associated with nuclear blasts etc.   A bomb goes off, EMP is generated and stuff that uses electricity is damaged.    Myself (the less senior and talented of the pair of us) and my coworker are intrigued as we are a bit of amatuer historians and military buffs, and our area has a high density of military types.   Maps are studied, trips are made, and my buddy decides to contact the local military base commander, who took pity on us and worked through the red tape, finally resulting in a pair of Men In Black types from his base showing up with hundreds of pounds of ""electronic gear"".  
   They took over a large office, put some extra physical security in place, and after about a week were able to record 2 instances of the problem occuring, the 2nd instance they were actually on site when it happened.  They left with knowing looks.  

  The base commander gets back to us and says ""get the relevant people at this site on XX day for a long meeting"".    So we trek down there where we were informed that our office building, which was sort of in an isolated location, was near some funny antenna thing.  This ""thing"" was actually a target for military electronic warfare testing:  an EW (plane, APC, ship, BUK missile , get it ? I am being vague) would pass by on its way back home, and shoot the antenna thing with its EMP thing trying to make baby Wild Weasels , and when this happened our building got hosed up and required a full network restart.   The MIB types were able to record what happened and linked it to the EW vehicle/plane/ship passing within a few miles at the time.

  The fix was two-fold- relocate all IT equipment into a mini-data center, and put in shielding to the room, which the military paid for and installed.  It was fairly simple- like aluminum sheets and perforated steel sheets that looked like fine-grained chain link fence, and nailed to the walls, ceiling , installed under tiles etc. sort of like a Faraday cage ?  I think it was leftover supplies from a bigger project on the nearby base.   The other was a procedural change- the electronic warfare stuff had new instructions to limit the duration and direction when the gadget was activated, in essence treating it like a canon that was never to be pointed other than as directed.

All it does is make people iterate through some form of their previous password with just a small tweak.

Just let people make a nice strong password and let them keep it.

It's funny that I just completed mandatory IT Security training that talked about password changes.  Most of what they recommend in the training I can't do.  Someone after much internal politiking got some ancient mainframe app linked into our identity management system.  The app can only handle password that are 6 characters minimum and 8 characters maximum, and it can only contain letter and numbers, no special characters.  So, now all our passwords need to be exactly 8 characters, upper case and lower case and a numbers, but no special characters.

He was a Sr. staff member who is suffering like all of us as my manager has allowed the IT dept. to have an unfilled helpdesk admin position exceeding 8mos. (that's another story altogether) 

After a few minutes of hearing the user holler/swear and watching him look back and forth between me and my subordinate, I informed him, ""there's no need to speak to him, you can speak to me."" (we share one, big IT office). He directed the next 5-10 minutes of his vitriol at me and I told him I would go to his office to see what I could do and that I needed 5 minutes to be there. I looked for his admin application and saw that it had been approved on Saturday and that we simply hadn't gotten to him yet. I went to his office and local admin was complete in 90 seconds.

I spent the next hour speaking with him about the importance of security policies and how another local government entity had recently been ransomewared, costing millions in losses because negotiating with data terrorists just encourages more data terrorism. I explained why implementing an air-gapped network wouldn't solve his picture of data independence (stuxtnet). I agreed with him that this slow-response situation is frustrating and if we can't offer the pending candidates enough compensation, we won't get them we'll end up with a low-quality employee who can't really resolve our labor deficiency. I encouraged him not to ""go to Sr. staff meeting this week and raise hell."" because a desperate mob will result in desperate measures. I empathized with him and while it took another hour of non-existent time away from our work, I wanted him to hear the ways we silently care for our users.

There was some more chatter and his softening posture resolved in us both acknowledging each other's importance and pain. We both apologized, thanked each other and shook hands. It was a slow and meaningful de-escalation that would not have occurred had my subordinate been in the room.

There are reasons we insulate our subordinates from department conflict like this: techs don't get paid enough to put up with the abuse and stakeholders will rarely apologize when faced with public humility.

[https://www.neowin.net/news/y2k22-bug-microsoft-rings-in-the-new-year-by-breaking-exchange-servers-all-around-the-world/](https://www.neowin.net/news/y2k22-bug-microsoft-rings-in-the-new-year-by-breaking-exchange-servers-all-around-the-world/)

——————————————————

Just wondering if any other Exchange admins had their new year’s celebration interrupted due to the “Microsoft Filtering Management Service” being stopped and reports of issues with mail flow?

In the application event logs, I see a bunch of errors from FIPFS service which say: Cannot convert “220101001” to long

If I look back further in the logs, it appears like it all started happening when the “MS Filtering Engine Update” process received the “220101001” update version just over an hour ago at 7:57pm EST.

EDIT: I’ve tried forcing it to check for another update, but it returned “MS Filtering Engine Update process has not detected any new scan engine updates”. ... ~~I’ve temporarily disabled anti-malware scanning, to restore mail flow for now.~~

TL DR; ~~Microsoft released a bad update for Exchange 2016 and 2019~~. 
~~Disabling OR bypassing anti-malware filtering will restore mail flow in the interim~~

UPDATE: according to @ceno666 the issue also seems to occur with the 220101002 update version as well. Could be related to, what I’m dubbing, the “Y2K22” bug. Refer to the comment from JulianSiebert about the “signed long” here: [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/december-2021-exchange-server-cumulative-updates-postponed/bc-p/3049189/highlight/true#M31885](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/december-2021-exchange-server-cumulative-updates-postponed/bc-p/3049189/highlight/true#M31885) The “long” type allows for values up to 2,147,483,647. It appears that Microsoft uses the first two numbers of the update version to denote the year of the update. So when the year was 2021, the first two numbers was “21”, and everything was fine. Now that it’s 2022 (GMT), the update version, converted to a “long” would be 2,201,01,001 - - which is above the maximum value of the “long” data type. @Microsoft: If you change it to an ‘unsigned long’, then the max value is 4,294,967,295 and we’ll be able to sleep easy until the year 2043!

~~UPDATE: Microsoft has confirmed disabling the malware filtering is the correct course of action for now (workaround to restore mail flow). While new signatures and engine updates have been released, they don’t seem to fix the issue. We’ll continue to wait for an official response from Microsoft. At least we have a third-party filtering/scanning solution in front of Exchange.~~

~~UPDATE: If you still have mail flow delays after disabling the malware filter, check your transport rules; you might have a rule that is trying to check attachments; reference this comment for information on finding the correct transport rule: [https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rt91z6/exchange\_2019\_antimalware\_bad\_update/hqtt5ib/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rt91z6/exchange_2019_antimalware_bad_update/hqtt5ib/)~~

~~UPDATE: Reddit user u/MarkDePalma created a custom script to roll back to 2021 and reportedly allows you to re-enable all malware filtering while we wait for a patch from Microsoft. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK, ‘John Titor’, haha. [https://blog.markdepalma.com/?p=810](https://blog.markdepalma.com/?p=810)~~

UPDATE, 01/01 14:39 EST (19:39 GMT): Microsoft has released a statement here: [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/email-stuck-in-transport-queues/ba-p/3049447](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/email-stuck-in-transport-queues/ba-p/3049447)

UPDATE, 01/02 01:45 EST (06:45 GMT): Microsoft has released a fix for the “Y2K22 Exchange Bug” *which requires action to be taken on each Exchange server in your environment*. Some system administrators report this fix can take around 30 minutes to run, which could increase depending on how many people are trying to simultaneously download the update from the Microsoft servers. Interestingly, this fix includes a change to the format of the problematic update version number; the version number now starts with “21” again, to stay within the limits of the ‘long’ data type, for example: “2112330001”. So, Happy December 33, 2021! 😉

I had no certifications and no degree, nor did I even have a passion at the time when I got in. At the time, it was just a job, and I need to move out of my parents.

The company took me under their wing, and I fell in love with the world of IT. From there, they set off a spark in me that at the time, I didn't know existed. I didn't even know how to reformat a laptop, it was terrifying.

My thirst for knowledge only increased, while my hate for help desk grew larger. I made it a goal to leave the help desk role, but understood that I have to go through the fire.

A year of that job and I got a position at the company I'm at now (A larger MSP of 25+ ish people), I continued to push my self and demonstrate that I can learn and tackle new and bigger challenges.

My help desk is back filled and I trained the guy to look after what I had created and maintained, so that I can move on to bigger projects. No more on call, no more (my printer doesn't work), and no more late night patching till 6 am in the morning!

I left amicably, he understood.  Time to move on, no real path forward where I was.  I offered to come back and help with their ERP and custom systems as needed, he threw out a ridiculous amount of money per hour that would be my rate.  I'm cool with that.

The OP will probably reply with something like ""I didn't ask for advice on silverware. I asked about how to clean soup of hands and how to treat burns from boiling soup on my hands. If you aren't going to help don't answer.""

Someone then jumps in and has to get more harsh with the OP and basically tell him he's a moron. At this point if he doesn't delete his post there's SOME hope.

There will be the guy who suggests a diamond encrusted spoon made out of platinum.

Someone else will suggest using the free plastic ones you can grab at McDonalds. 

There will be commentary about using consumer class spoons and how you must work for a really shitty small place if you think you can hand an executive a spoon made out of plastic.

Meanwhile someone will say using a spoon is a best practice for eating soup.

Someone will challenge that and claim they have 25 years of experience and they use a fork. 

Someone else will suggest using a piece of broken glass as a sort of spoon. Someone else will say that's incredibly dangerous and stupid and the best practice is to use a spoon, and spoons really aren't that expensive anyway.

Then someone (probably me) will say thats incredibly stupid that because you don't follow best practices you try to argue they don't exist and that your fucked up method is a viable option.

Then someone will say they hate soup and would rather eat a sandwich.

Someone else will say you should know how to eat soup and sandwiches because its a multi-food environment in 2017.

Someone will tell the OP that he should quit immediately if he's eating soup with his hands and get a better job.

dt7alu,sysadmin,1573173434.0,"There are some common themes of concern that I see pop up in this sub. I want to offer some advice from my years in a range of IT roles that will help reassure you that what you're experiencing is not uncommon. And some advice to help you flourish in the workplace

**1. Everybody makes mistakes**. – As a graduate/ entry level employee your managers expect you to make mistakes. When you do make a mistake the best thing you can do is own up to it, apologise, and seek advice/ demonstrate you’re going to take steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again. Watch closely how management/ senior team members take blame. Largely when they’re blamed for a mistake they accept it very calmly, apologise, and move on. When you’re in an entry level role you have next to no accountability & responsibility, and any issues you cause may have your manager receive a please explain, but you shouldn’t receive anything worse than getting asked what happened.

**2. There is going to be a lot that you don’t know (and that’s ok).** There will be a large gap between the knowledge you gain from your academic course and what you will be applying in your professional role. The absolute best thing you can do for your career progression is to admit when you don’t know something, and ask for clarification on anything you don’t understand. I have previously worked as the IT operations manager for a fortune 500, and I’m now in a senior technology consulting role for a pseudo-government organisation, and I am still the first person in any given room to say “I don’t know what that means.” Sometimes it’s a genuine gap in my knowledge, largely it’s language, acronyms, and terms that are specific to an organisation/ department.

**3. Customer relations are everything** **– we are a service industry**. You have to view your interpersonal skills as another area that you should actively work on and upskill. “Good customer service skills” is usually the number one thing on the “required skills” section for a position, and the main thing recruiters and managers are looking for from the interview stage onwards. When a future employer calls your references the main question they will be asking is “what are they like as a person?” Good rapport building ability & interpersonal communication skills are the number one reason you will be asked to renew your contract, move to permanent, asked if you would like to come work for \_\_\_\_ Company (getting poached). In general someone with a 5/10 technical competency but 10/10 charisma will get far more favourable career opportunities than someone with 10/10 technical expertise and a 5/10 charisma.

**4. Impostor syndrome, a lot of people in IT experience it.** You are going to walk into a lot of roles, projects, teams, orgs, etc. where you might feel in over your head, and the job requires more expertise than you can give. The reality is dealing with this situation is in the job description of our whole industry. See point 2, no one can know everything in IT, it’s one of the beauties of our industry, you can (and have to) continuously learn and upskill. Over time you will learn to deal with this situation, and grow the confidence and belief in yourself that when you feel like this you will be able to break it down and work through it. I personally remind myself that all I’m ever doing is moving around 1s and 0s.

**5. Learn how to speak professionally.** You’re not expected to know how to do this day one, but pay close attention to how management & senior team members speak in formal meetings. Do research into how to convey what you need to articulate in a professional manor.

In my experience a great place to watch people exercise this is watch press conferences, especially sports press conferences. Players and coaches speak in very broad terms, they’re excellent at deferring questions they don’t want to, or aren’t prepared to answer i.e. “there are rumours you’re looking at incorporating \[blank\] into your team, what can you tell us about that?” “That is definitely something we’re looking into, however at this time we haven’t held those discussions to make any fully informed decision. We’ll be looking into it and once we’re comfortable all facts have been considered we will make a decision and look at incorporating that into our team.”

Additionally try to eliminate the soft “just” from your professional vocab i.e. “I’m just following up on...” “I thought I had better just add…”

**6. Look for areas of improvement. Don’t turn up every day and only keep the company cogs turning.** Actively look for areas of improvement, and raise them with senior team members/ management. They don’t have to be organisation wide major changes, they can be updating documentation, automating tasks common to your team, find small efficiencies in process. In an entry level position try to find improvements in this criteria set:

1. Improves productivity
2. Is low risk to implement
3. Is free to implement.

Changing your mindset to look for opportunities for improvement is challenging at first, but once you begin to see some, you will see a lot. And this is the perfect gateway towards providing major improvement to your organisation once you’re more technically proficient (and trusted by management).

**7. Sometimes you won’t be hired, and it’s not your fault.** Different employers want different things. Example: Two different managers I know have two opposite philosophies on previous employment period lengths. One believes if a candidate has been in the same position & company for more than two years they won’t get an interview because they don’t want someone whose progression & upskilling stagnates. The other believes if they have been at more than 3 companies in 5 years they won’t get looked at because they’re just company & pay hopping. Regardless of reason for leaving.

Additionally when deciding between the last 2-4 candidates for a role the discussion largely turns to which we think would fit into the team and culture better (see point 3), and sometimes, to no fault of your own, that won’t be you. Last month we held interviews for a new position in my team, we selected a candidate that was less qualified, less experienced, less professional (in his communication) than the next best candidate. Yet our selection panel of three unanimously decided to choose the candidate with less experience because we believed he was a better fit to our current team structure & culture (and of course showed exceptional aptitude for the required skills of the role).

Feel free to disagree & offer a different viewpoint to anything I’ve said here.

From 3rd party solutions to OEM solutions from companies like Lenovo and Dell, I have yet to find a USB C docking station that works reliably.

q1x24a,sysadmin,1633442700.0,"I started working at this company when I was pretty green to being a sysadmin. I worked there for about 5 years and moved from a sysadmin to a senior sysadmin. I never made the money I thought I deserved once I excelled in my position and received the senior role, so I amicably moved on from the company. I've worked at three different companies during this time and gained a lot of valuable experience as well as a few relevant certifications. 

I got the call from my old boss (glad I still had his office number saved) and we talked about me coming back. They are offering me an engineering position that didn't exist at the time of my employment. The company has grown dramatically since my departure and he assured me that raises and budget are no longer the issue they once were. He offered me over double what I was making 3.5 years ago, pushing me past the 6 figure mark which had always been a goal of mine. I was told I would get 5% annual raises in writing in my offer letter. All fully remote (WFH used to be a privilege at this company, and I only got one day a week back then.)

So I'm writing all of this to remind people not to burn bridges in your industry!! I left amicably over a money dispute (they couldn't give me the raise I wanted because of ""company policy""), but they obviously remembered me all of these years later when they needed another engineer. Don't stick around with a company if you don't feel like they pay you what you're worth. Don't be afraid to job hop and learn new skills.

Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don't match in DNS. 

The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that's inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.

Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server's A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.

I just wanted to follow up with what we discovered  during our post mortem meetings, now that normalcy has entered my office again. It took months to overhaul the security of the firm and do serious soul searching in the IT department.

I wanted to share some serious consequences from the incident and I not even calling out the political nonsense as I did a pretty good with that in my last post. Just know the situation escalated to such a hurricane of shit that we had a meeting in the mens room. At one point I was followed into the bathroom while I was taking a long delayed shit, and was forced to have an impromptu war room update while I was on the stall because people could not wait. I still cannot fathom that the CTO, CISO(she was week three on the job and fresh out of orientation), general consul, and CFO who was dialed in on someone's cell phone on speaker all heard me poop.  

I want to properly close out this story and share it with the world, learn from my company's mistakes you do not want to be in the situation I was in the last 4 months.

(Also if you want to share some feedback or a horror story please share It helps me sleep easier at night that I'm not being tormented alone)

Some takeaways I found

\-We discovered things were getting deployed to production without having been scanned for vulnerabilities or were not following standard security build policy. People would just fill out a questionnaire and deploy then forget. From now security will baked into the deployment and risk exceptions will be tracked. There were shortcuts all over the place. Legacy Domains that were still up and routable, test environments connected to our main network, worst yet was the lack of control on accounts and active directory. We shared passwords across accounts or accounts had access to way to much privilege which allowed the attacker to move laterally from server to server.  BTW we are a fairly large company with several thousand servers, apps, and workstations.

\-We also had absolutely no plan for a crippling ransomware attack like this. Our cloud environment did not fully replicate our on prem data center and our DR site was designed to an handle one server or application restore at a time over 100 mb line. When there was a complete network failure believe me this did not fly. Also our backups were infrequently tested, no one checked if the backups were finishing without errors, and for cash saving reasons were only being taken once a month.  With no forensic/data recovery vendor on staff or tap we had to quickly find a vendor who had availability on short notice which we found was easier said than done. We were charged a premium rate because it was such short notice and we were not in a position to penny pinch or shop around.

\-This attack was very much a smash and grab. Whoever the attacker was decided it wasn't worth preforming extensive recon or trying to leave behind backdoors. They ransomed the windows servers which housed vmware and hyper v and caused a cascade of applications and systems to go down. Most of our stuff was virtualized on these machines so they did significant damage. To top it off a few hours into the incident the attacker dropped the running config on our firewalls. I'm not a networking person but setting that backup with all the requirements for our company took weeks. I'll never exactly know why they felt the need to do this, the malware only worked on windows so it's a possibility they figured this would throw our linux servers configs off the fritz (which it did) but my best guess is they wanted us to feel the pain as much as possible to try and force us to pay up.

\-If you're wondering how they got to firewall credentials without doing extensive recon or using advanced exploits. Basically we had an account called netadmin1 which was an account used to login into servers hosting network monitoring and performance apps. When the compromised active directory they figured correctly the password was the same for the firewalls gui page. BTW the firewall gui was not restricted if you knew how to type [http://Firewall](http://Firewall) IP address in web browser you could reach it anywhere on our network.  

\-Even with these holes numerous opportunities were missed to contain this abomination against IT standards. Early that morning US East time a Bangladesh based developer noticed password spraying attempts were filling up his app logs. Which super concerned him because the app was on his internal dev-test web server and not internet facing. He rightfully suspected that there were too many things not adding up for this to be a maintenance miscong or security testing. The problem was he didn't know how to properly contact cyber security. He tried to get into contact people on the security team but was misdirected to  long defunct shared mailboxes or terminated employees. When he did reach the proper notification channels it sat unread in shared a mailbox, he had taken the time to grep out the compromised accounts and hostnames and was trying to have someone confirm that this was malicious or not.  Unfortunately the reason he seems to have been ignored was the old stubborn belief that people overseas or remotely cry wolf too often and aren't technical enough to understand security. Let me tell you that is not the explanation you want to have to give in a root cause analysis presentation to C level executives. The CISO was so atomically angry when she heard this I'm pretty sure the fires in her eyes melted our office smart board because it never worked again after that meeting.

\-A humongous mistake was keeping the help desk completely out of the loop for hours. Those colleagues aren't just brainless customer service desk jockeys they are literally the guardians against the barbarians otherwise called the end users. By the time management stopped flinging sand, sludge. and poop at each other on conference calls, hours had passed without setting up comms for the help desk. When one of the network engineers went upstairs to see why they weren't responding to emails laying out the emergency plan. He walked into an office that been reduced to utter chaos some Lovecraft cross between the thunder dome, the walking dead, and the battle of Verdun. Their open ticket queue was into the stratosphere, the phones lines were jammed by customers and users calling nonstop, and the marketing team was so fed up they went up there acting like cannibals and starting ripping any help desk technician they could get their hands on limb from limb. There was serious bad blood between help desk and operations after this for good reason this could not have been handled worse.

\-My last takeaway was accepting that I'm not superman and eventually had to turn down a request. This was day two of the shit storm and everyone had been working nonstop. I stopped only 5 hours around 11 pm to go home and sleep, I even took my meals on status update calls. We were really struggling to make sure people were eating and sleeping and not succumbing to fatigue.  We already had booked two people in motels near our DR site to work in shifts because the restore for just critical systems alone needed 24 hour eyeballs on it to make sure there were no errors during the restore. We had already pulled off some Olympian feats in few hours which included getting VIP emails back online and critical payment software flowing as far as customers, suppliers and contractors were concerned the outage only lasted a few hours. Of course they had no idea the accounting team was shackled to desks working around the clock doing all the work on pen paper and excel on some ancient loaner laptops. So when I arrived at the office at 730 am still looking like a shell shocked survivor of Omaha beach. The CFO immediately pole vaulted into my cubicle the moment I sit down and proceeds to hammer throw me and my manager into his office. He starts breaking down that ""finance software we've never heard of"" hasn't been brought back online and it's going to cause a catastrophe if it's not back online soon. I go through the list of critical applications that could not fail and what he was talking about was not on there. I professionally remind we are in crisis mode and can't take special requests right now. He insists that the team has been patient and that is app is basically there portal to do everything. I think to myself then why I haven't heard of it before part of the security audit six months was to inventory our software subscriptions. Unless and I cringed there's some shadow IT going on.

This actually made its way up to the CEO and we had to spend a security analyst to go figure out what accounting is talking about. What he found stunned me after two straight days of this cannot get worse moments it got worse. 15 years ago a sysadmin who had reputation for being a mad scientist type. He took users special requests via emails without ever ticket tracking, make random decisions  without documentation, and would become hostile if you tried to get information out him, for ten years this guy was the bane of my existence. He retired in 2011 and according to his son unfortunately passed in 2015 to be with his fellow sith lords in the valley of dark lords this guy was something else even in death. Apparently he took it upon himself to build finance some homegrown software without telling anyone. When we did domain migrations he just never retired an old domain, took leftover 4 windows 2000 servers ( yes you read that correctly) and 2 ancient redhat servers since the licenses still worked and struck them in a closet for 15 years with a house fan from Walmart.

The finance team painstakingly continued using this software for almost two decades, assuming IT had been keeping backups and monitoring the application. They had designed years of workflow around this mystery software. I had never seen it before but through some investigations it was described as web portal the team logged into to a carnival house of tasks, including forecasting, currency conversion, task tracking, macro generation/editing, and various batch jobs. My stomach started to hurt because all those things sounded very different from another and I was getting very confused on how this application was doing all this on windows 2000 servers. I was even more perplexed when I was told the windows 2000 servers were hosting the sql database and the app hosted on red hat. The whole team was basically thinking to themselves that doesn't make sense how is all of this communicating. Two of the servers were already long dead when we found them which then lead us to find out they were sending support tickets to mailbox only the mad scientist admin had control over. It blew my mind that no one questioned why they're tickets were going unanswered especially when one of the portals to this web application died permanently with the server it was on. They were still routable and some of our older admin accounts worked( it took us an hour of trying to login) but the ransomware apparently was backwards compatible and had infected the remaining windows 2000 servers. I did not understand how this monster even worked zero documentation.

We looked and looked to understand how it worked because the web app appeared to have windows paths but also had Linux utilities. I did not understand how this thing was cobbled together but we eventually figured it out this maniac installed wine on the redhat server then installed cygwin on wine then compiled the windows application and it ran for 15 years  kinda of. I threw up after this was explained to me. After 48 hours straight of continuous work this broke me, I told the CFO I didn't have a solution and couldn't have one for considerable time. The implications of this were surreal, it took a dump on all the initiatives we thought we were taking over the years. It was up to his team to find an alternative solution this was initially not well received but I had to put my foot down, I don't have superpowers.

I hope you all enjoyed the ride remember test your backups

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Update\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I was not expecting this to get so many colorful replies but I do appreciate  the incident response advice that's been given out. I am taking points from the responses to apply in my plan.

A few people asked but I honestly don't know how the wine software worked. I can't wrap my head around how the whole thing communicated and had all those features. Another weird thing was that certain features also stopped working over the years according to witnesses. I'm not sure if there was some kind of auto deletion going on either because those hard drives were not huge, they were at least ten years old. Its mystery better left unsolved. 

The developer who was the Cassandra in this story had a happy ending. He's a contractor month to month usually and his contract was extended a full two years. He may not know it yet but if he ever comes to the states he's getting a life time supply of donuts.

Few months back we had an urgent ticket come in, estates had installed some expensive new building management (BMS) kit and now needed all the sensors networked in, some in really funky locations - think underground access conduits and roof spaces. Obviously without any heads up to IT. Not a simple fix, and thus it's one of those calls that emails start getting cc'd to directors and people are getting angry.

So we run with it and design where we need to run new fibre, what devices we will place where, well documented and scope done, but because of the complications in this work (think drilling a couple of 6"" reinforced concrete walls that are both firestops and holding up a 5 story building above) we pass back the documents to estates (who have qualified surveyors) and say can you can you please manage and implement.

That was 6 months ago and nothing happened.

I panic.  I try counting to 10, but in the datacenter, no one can hear you scream... let alone hearing yourself count.  

15 minutes, and I'm plugging the switch back in, then off.  then on... Nothing.  Eventually, as I realize that batteries only last so long in the UPS, my anxiety hits a peak as I imagine all of these helpless servers powering down, and I pull out my phone.

We saw this post [Earn your Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fzaeps/earn_your_microsoft_azure_fundamentals/) from u/digitalwhitewater and some other cross postings about the events, and wanted to give you an update. Some of you received notices that your registration was cancelled due to capacity limits, while others were concerned because this specific event was in the Central Europe region and the time zone didn’t align to where you are. Well, good news on both fronts! We are standing up additional events to help meet the skilling demands of this community. Once they are posted and available for registration, we will post here again so you have DIRECT links to register and don’t have to find each event on your own. The r/sysadmin community is important to us and we’re glad to hear that Azure Fundamentals is important to you. We will look forward to welcoming you to a different event VERY SOON!

And, for those of you who were asking about the price: The training is free, the exam is $99, but if you attend the full training, you get a discount voucher for the full cost of the exam.

EDIT 1: A Few answers to the most commonly asked questions - 1) Exam Vouchers will be sent around 5 business days after the LAST day of the event.  You must attend both days (if a 2 day event) to receive the voucher. 2) The link to join the event typically shows up around 6 hours before the event starts. If you are confirmed you should get the join link at the 6 hour mark. Remember the join link is UNIQUE to you and is how you get credit for attendance.  Please don't post it or send it to your friends :).

# SHA-2 only for updates for Win7 and Server 2008/R2

Microsoft already announced it end of last year: With the next patchday, all new updates for the older Windows versions, will be delivered with SHA-2 signatures only. If your clients or WSUS (If it runs on Server 2008R2 or older) are not fully patched, you might not be able to download/install new updates.

[Here's the Microsoft article about the changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4472027/2019-sha-2-code-signing-support-requirement-for-windows-and-wsus).

So please make sure, that  KB4484071 installed on your WSUS (If it runs on 2008R2 or older) and that your WSUS clients have KB4474419 and KB4490628 installed.

&#x200B;

# Decommission of old Windows Update endpoints

Microsoft will decommission older endpoints for WSUS. Your WSUS should update automatically (the first synchronization might take longer than ususal) to the new URL.

If you are getting SOAPException errors while synchronizing after monday, you have to update the URL manually.

[Here's the article about how the update your WSUS.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4482416/wsus-synchronization-fails-with-soapexception)

Seeing as it's not so easy to actually track it down and enable everything by hand if you have handful of DCs and Domains under you I decided to simplify my job a bit. I've automated the whole process during the weekend by updating my 3 PowerShell Modules that I use frequently. Now with 3 commands and 8 lines of code, you can track events, enable/disable diagnostics for LDAP to actually find which machine/account is doing that and finally scan your DC's if those are affected.

&#x200B;

* The first part is tracking the events that can tell you if you're affected, and exactly which machines/accounts are affected.

&#x200B;

    $Events = Find-Events -Report LdapBindingsDetails,LdapBindingsSummary -DatesRange Last7days -DetectDC
    $Events
    $EVents.LdapBindingsSummary | Out-htmlView -ScrollX
    $Events.LdapBindingsDetails | Out-HtmlView -ScrollX

Above is based on my PSWinReportingV2 PowerShell module to - you can read about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/bicwjq/the\_only\_powershell\_command\_you\_will\_ever\_need\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/bicwjq/the_only_powershell_command_you_will_ever_need_to/)

It allows you to easily define report, date range and scan events on all DC's within a Forest. It also translates it to a nice, readable format.

Sources for PSWinReportingV2: [https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting)

&#x200B;

* The second part is a helper module to enable/disable diagnostic logs. It's required to get the LdapBindingsDetails report. You basically need to enable logs for LDAP to see which machines/accounts are doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

    Get-WinADDiagnostics
    Set-WinADDiagnostics -Diagnostics 'LDAP Interface Events' -Level Basic -SkipRoDC

This is based on ADEssentials PowerShell Module which can get current diagnostics status for each dc in a forest/domain or just part of it.

Sources for ADEssentials: [https://github.com/EvotecIT/ADEssentials](https://github.com/EvotecIT/ADEssentials)

&#x200B;

* 3rd part is just a bonus. This scans all DCS to see if those are affected or not.

&#x200B;

    invoke-testimo -Sources DCLDAPInsecureBindings -showreport

Finally, this is based on the Testimo project which allows you to scan domain for forest/domain for issues.

Sources for testimo: [https://github.com/EvotecIT/Testimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Testimo)

&#x200B;

All 4 commands are available when you install 3 PowerShell modules.

    Install-Module PSWinReportingV2 -Force
    Install-Module Testimo -Force
    Install-Module ADEssentials -Force # actually Testimo will install ADEssentials so not really needed

As always before installing - review the code to see and understand what you're getting into. I did test this on 3 different forests and it seems to do its job properly.

In the past 2 weeks, I found out that one of my bosses made the decision to purchase a phone recording software that will track and record all conversations that take place, pretty standard practice in my experience, but how I found out was that I had end users ask me if these emails from *software company* were a phishing attempt or if it was real. I then had to scramble and ask my other boss and he said that it's the software the CEO purchased. Now I'm going to have to drive over an hour to our site where our phones are based out of and work with the vendor to set up their server so that they can begin recording our phones. Not one email or text was ever sent to me asking me my opinion or experience with software like that. I also found out that the general managers of one of our stores began setting up an e-commerce page that is linked to one of our websites and the company needed a subdomain with a CNAME record point it to a certain URL.

When we upgraded to 2015 a few years back, we expressed the case to have a HA SQL server just on the off chance of an issue like this, however, cost in Azure or OnPrem for it was a lot so management decided to risk having a single server.

Well last Monday-Wednesday we had a major problem with the VHD that the databases live on, took me hours to find out because the issue looked like a problem with our RDS environment (in my defense there was 5 issues that happened almost at once, 4 were in RDS and are now resolved due to what I saw in the logs).

Around 2pm on day 1 of the troubleshooting, our Sales VP walks into my office (boss was on vacation btw) and asks:

Sales - ""Is it back yet?

Me - ""No.""

Sales - ""How much longer?""

Me - ""Ill send an email when its fixed""

Sales - ""Well this is taking to long""

He sent an email shaming IT for not having this fixed yet, yada yada yada. My boss was about to send a reply about the issue, though he was going to send it later since he was angry in how the manager worded it. Before he could even finish it, out COO (same one from my prior post about the office in another state) sends an email to the VP with my boss CCed essentially telling him that he ""Has no patience for the sales managers BS and that Iwifia is doing everything he can to fix the problem. If the sales team does not have a contingency plan for this then maybe they should have offered up the budget to afford the High Availability server that they lobbied against"".

I am not going to lie... I laughed harder than I should have.

**UPDATE:** Sales VP calls a meeting with my boss about this. He has our COO and CFO on standby, my boss does, just incase the VP gets pushy. Oddly enough he offered to sell having an HA server to pull the money from his budget and accountings budget to pay for it. Infact he may take care of half the RDS/App/SQL farm (2300 per month roughly before scaling and poweroffs).

Every time something happens at scale conversations are stopped and stuck into a single thread leaving everyone with a wall of text to filter through to find discussions relevant to your environment.

Sure merge identical threads but pooling the Spectre stuff makes it a nightmare to have meaningful conversation. 

Edit: here's my proposal:

~~When something like this happens again create a megathread which serves as an index to the various discussions taking place in other threads. If a thread is found to be a duplicate pick the most comprehensive and link the other back there ie only allow one thread discussing ""Spectre on Windows"" but allow a separate thread for Unix systems.~~

Edit: Here's another option:

More often than not member of this community invest a boat load of effort to sort through information on the internet and come up with [posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7o2h3n/summary_of_useful_links_and_info_for/). The problem is that post can only be edited by its OP and megathreads can only be edited by mods so why not have a megathread which points to a wiki page which we can collectively update as information becomes available? 

That way we can create a high level ""start here"" sort of page which explains the issue for those not from /r/sysadmin and links to threads which have a more specific scope ie ""Spectre on Windows"" as a simple example. 

  Either way, how it is now just dosn't work. Information is either spread between multiple threads or hiding inside multiple comments in a megathread which makes the information equally hard to find.

I told him about the mail I had send back in April 2020 and told him that their recent security breaches, and their handling of them (blaming an intern), most certainly hadn't changed my opinion of them - quite the contrary.

He told me he was SO glad I mentioned that, because that gave him an opportunity to clarify that the security breach was limited to the US part of Solarwinds, and that the EU part of Solarwinds was unaffected.

I don't think this is unreasonable for data recovery. after about 8 hours I was able to retrieve the files she needed. (luckily the ransomware didn't hit the shadow copies) there were 1000's of files. The server was old (14 years) so I recommended getting a cheap refurbished server and a NAS or purchase some cloud storage so her business essential files would not be lost. She thanked me and said I saved her business 1000's of labor hours remaking all of these documents.   


She asked me to quote everything.

This is when it all goes down hill. I get a text message saying ""how is it $400"" I explained it is for recovering the files and setting up and upgrading her environment. She proceeded to claim I never was asked to recover files. I explained that that was the original job and I saved her business 1000's. she asked me to provide documentation and since the original job was discussed over the phone I had none.

n8gdyb,sysadmin,1620573739.0,"I'm 40 this year and I've noticed my mind is no longer as nimble as it once was. Learning new things takes longer and my ability to go mental gymnastics with following the problem or process not as accurate. This is the progression of age we all go through ofcourse, but in a field that changes from one day to the next how do you compete with the younger crowd? 

Like a lot of people I'll likely be working another 30 years and I'm asking how do I stay in the game? Can I handle another 30 years of slow decline and still have something to offer? I have considered certs like the PMP maybe, but again, learning new things and all that.

The field is new enough that people retiring after a lifetime of work in the field has been around a few decades, but it feels like things were not as chaotic in the field. Sure it was more wild west in some ways, but as we progress things have grown in scope and depth. Let's not forget no one wants to pay for an actual specialist anymore. They prefer a jack of all trades with a focus on something but expect them to do it all. 

Maybe I'm getting burnt out like some of my fellow sys admins on this subreddit. It is a genuine concern for myself so I thought I'd see if anyone held the same concerns or even had some more experience of what to expect. I love learning new stuff, and losing my edge is kind of scary I guess. I don't have to be the smartest guy, but I want to at least be someone who's skills can be counted on.

fdorvf,sysadmin,1583377382.0,"Anyone here have to deal with the scum-of-the-earth that is an x-ray vendor?

One of my clients is in the medical field.  They recently (without talking to IT) decided to go with two vendors.  They went with CareStream for their 3D imaging, and Genoray for their conebeam imaging.

We get pre-installed Windows 10 boxes running their software.  We join them to the domain and then install our remote access tool.  Both companies connect the x-ray unit to the PC via dedicated ethernet cable on a separate NIC.

Both companies are atrocious.  I've been dealing with Genoray for the last three days on a new install.

""Hi, it's u/darkpixel2k at <company> and the conebeam is down at our XYZ office.  It says it can't connect.""

""Hmm...do you have any anti-virus or a firewall software installed?""

This is how it starts \*every\* time with both companies.

He noticed the Windows Firewall was enabled on the ""public network"".  He insisted we disable it.  I pointed out that the network card connecting the workstation to the domain was under the ""Domain Network"" and that firewall was disabled.  I pointed out that the other network was under the ""Private Network"" and that firewall was disabled too.

Nope.  We had to disable the public firewall in group policy before they would proceed.  Surprise, it didn't fix the issue.

Then he insisted it was AV.  We uninstalled it and it didn't fix the issue.

Then he insisted it was probably a Windows Update and we shouldn't just randomly patch machines.  So he did a Windows Restore back to a point about 30 days ago....and the workstation lost its domain trust...and lost our remote support tool.  No one could connect anymore...and it was 4:30 PM...and it's a several hour drive to get a tech on-site to that office.

So the next day a tech gets on-site and can't sign in to the box.  I suspect there was a LAPS password change somewhere right around the time the box lost its connection to the DC.  Anyways, he can't sign in.  We use a password reset USB stick and break back in to the box.  We remove it from the domain, clean up the computer account, and re-join it.

I reach out to Genoray again.  The tech I worked with is out, so I get stuck with a new tech.

""Hmm...do you have anti-virus or firewall software installed?""

\*sigh\*

""No.  We removed it yesterday during troubleshooting.""

He connects in to the box, sees that it still won't connect, says ""reboot the head unit and call back if there are problems"" and immediately hangs up.

Guess what?  It didn't fix it.

I call them back, and finally get the tech to connect in.  He pokes around looking everywhere for a firewall and/or AV.  After he finds nothing, he turns to Windows Updates.

""Hey...it looks like this box hasn't been updated in a while...you should really keep it up-to-date.""

""Yeah...about that....the box \*WAS\* up-to-date \*YESTERDAY\* before the other idiot tech rolled it back by 30 days.  That's where the updates went.""

""Oh...ok.  Well--I'm going to install these.  Call me back when they are done."" \*click\*

Amazingly, that didn't fix it.  I call back, he connects in, checks for a firewall and AV software again, then checks Windows Updates again, then finally wonders off to the Add/Remove Programs list.

""What's this 'communications client'?""

""It's our remote support tool.  Basically a better version of the LogMeIn123 software you are using.""

""I'm pretty sure that's the problem.  It's the only thing left on the box that we didn't install originally.""

""Ok--but once it's uninstalled, I can't reconnect"" (that's a lie--I can RDP in).

I glance at the clock and notice it's getting on to 4:30 PM...he's gonna do it....

He uninstalls my remote access client and reboots.  There's a long silence while he runs some tests.

""Did it work?"" I ask.

""......mmm.....uh.....that's odd...."" he mumbles ""Oh...I just got disconnected.  You can't connect in?""

""No.""

""Well...I need to get back in.  You'll have to get me reconnected so I can continue troubleshooting.""

""The office is several hours away""

""Oh...yeah...we're closing in 30 minutes.  Can you call back tomorrow?""

""What would you do if you were connected right now?  I mean...what's your game plan.  What do you think the problem might be?""

""Uh...well...I think the problem is that the PC is joined to the domain.""

""....??  So what are you saying?  It can't be on the network?""

""These PCs are designed to be stand-alone.  They aren't supposed to be part of a network, and they aren't supposed to have any unauthorized software installed.""

""Are you @$#&\^\* kidding me?  It wasn't AV.  It wasn't the firewall.  It wasn't our communication client.  It wasn't Windows Updates.  It wasn't the lack of Windows Updates you created.  It wasn't anything other than your absolute #@!$& software!  Federal law requires us to maintain records for 8 years in most cases.  It \*MUST\* be on a network so we can back it up.  Your unencrypted external USB hard drive sitting ON TOP OF THE DAMN MACHINE doesn't count.  Let's ignore the fact that the hard drive in the PC isn't encrypted too.  Or that you require the logged-in user to be a local admin on the PC...to apparently communicate to a device that's attached via ethernet cable...  I'm not leaving an unmanaged, unprotected, insecure workstation with local admin users connected to our patient network.  It's either on the domain, or it will have no network connection.""

""Uh...if you can call back tomorrow we can continue troubleshooting.""

I had a similar conversation with CareStream a few months ago.  Their rep replied to the ""no AV, no firewall, local admins"" argument with ""We're in-use by the Veterans Administration, and we even have equipment installed on nuclear subs.  I assure you, we're very secure.""

""Would that happen to be the same VA that's been breached 4 or 5 times in the last 15 years?  I wonder if your security policies had anything to do with it.""

I really hate medical software vendors in general.  I'm never surprised when I hear about patient data being breached, lost, or stolen.  Eaglesoft and Dentrix have similar policies--folders containing patient data where Everyone has full-control, installers that blindly install updates from folders their software shares out with Everyone full-control.  Problems generating \*PDF\* documents where the resolution is ""make the user a local admin"".

Anyone else forced to deal with horrible companies like these?  Any ideas on solving these issues?  At this point I'm seriously considering putting them on a separate VLAN that only has internet access and keeping documentation from the vendors where they say they don't support proper backups or disk encryption and presenting it as Exhibit A if the data is ever breached/stolen.

UPDATE: We reached back out this morning and they still couldn't fix it.  They asked us to reinstall Windows using the USB key that was in the parts kit they left.  ...except there was no USB key.  So they asked us to go to Walmart and buy Windows 10 Pro and install it.  When we refused, they sent us a link to the ISO they use to install the software.  We wiped and installed it...but there are no NIC drivers.  We are still waiting for their techs to call us back to instruct us on what to do next.  You know...because it's a ""special medical device"" (as some people have commented) and we aren't allowed to do \*anything\* to it without approval and explicit direction.

UPDATE 2: The vendor walked our tech through reinstalling Windows.  After Windows was reinstalled, the vendor began installing Windows Updates and then went home because it was 5 PM.  This morning the vendor connected in and came to a startling conclusion....not only does the vendor not back up the box (they expect us to without being able to install any software or join it to the domain), but they had instructed the tech to install Windows to the data drive.  All patient data is gone.  The tech is going back on-site to ""reinstall Windows properly"" so they can install Windows Updates...which should bring us up to 5 PM...which means quitting time for the vendor.

I'd really like everyone who posted that these are ""medical devices"" that have ""advanced security"" that we are unaware of, and ""we should NEVER install software on them because FDA \*mumble\* \*mumble\*"" that the vendor destroyed all patient data and then said ""Oh, you don't have backups?"".  We reminded the vendor that  we were told to NEVER install software on these machines.  There was a long pause--probably caused by the segfault occurring in their brain, and then they asked us to reinstall Windows.

UPDATE 3: After we reinstalled Windows a second time, the vendor reinstalled their software...and it still didn't work.  They are now asking for a third reinstall and are promising to send a tech out if the third reinstall doesn't work.  They said ""just reinstall Windows and don't touch it, don't domain join it, don't do anything"".  ""Exactly how we did it last time and you still couldn't get it working?  What about backups?  What about the fact that you keep saying it's a medical device and we can't touch it...yet you're having some rando tech do the reinstall?  Are you willing to take on that liability?""  That's when the support manager put his hand over the phone and said something containing the word ""idiot"" and ""just deal with it"".  The non-manager tech said ""we'll see if we can handle backups after we get the issue fixed.  If we can't fix it today, we'll get our own tech scheduled to go on-site.""

UPDATE 4: The x-ray vendor finally ""fixed"" the problem and pronounced the machine ready to go.  We left it off our network without our remote access tools.  The next morning the office called to say it was down again.  We said ""we can't help you, call Genoray"".  They called Genoray who connected back in, found it was broken, fixed it again...and the next morning it was down again.  Now they are saying it's a ""bad network cable"" and we need to replace it.

Except in a few rare instances, I've been able to leave my work at work at the stroke of 5pm. I like the problem-solving, I like working with technology, and I do like being respected as an expert with our customers. There's just one, major thing I so utterly hate, that I struggle to maintain enjoyment from my job:

On-call.

No matter where I go, or where I even consider going, there's the threat of on-call. At my old job, they paid you handsomely for every hour you were on-call (but they doled it out as ""bonus pay"" which took a significant chunk in taxes out of it). Even getting a nice, fat check at the end of an on-call week wasn't worth it to me. At my new job, they pay you a flat amount every week you're on call. I'd say that's nice for weeks where you don't get any calls, but I'm anxious the whole week. My sleep suffers, and I can't leave my laptop anywhere, which means I can't go do anything without the fear of having to turn right back around when my cell phone rings. I've determined that they literally could not pay me enough to be on-call for me to consider it an acceptable part of the job. Plus, when I need to escalate something, or need another pair of eyes on a high-impact issue, it's damn near impossible to get help during non-work hours. 

I don't know why it affects me so much. I'm generally a pretty stoic/calm-headed guy, but on-call affects me on such a personal level for some reason. I immediately feel powerless and alone when my phone rings during non-work hours. I hate it so much. But therein lies the problem. It's everywhere. I can't find a job in this field that doesn't require some bit of on-call. Is this just the field? Are there any jobs that don't suffer from the threat of on-call? I've even considered going back to school to do something completely different, but I don't really have the time or the money to do so.

I started writing this post and realized it was going to be a long one, so TL;DR is above. The story of getting from zeroes to heroes follows ...

\-----

IT at this company has had a rough time of it. When I joined in late 2018, there were two IT support personnel. One of whom ran IT, and Security, and Facilities. The other was completely overwhelmed and stressed out to the point of cracking. I think we had around 220 employees.  
A lot of work was outsourced, meaning projects got done, but with precious little documentation or integration with the rest of the systems. Machines were all built by hand. IAM was a barely-updated spreadsheet (or, as it turned out, two contradicting ones). We maintained a datacenter for our engineers that had no documentation, was a rats nest of cabling, made barely any sense to anybody, and was a nightmare to do anything in.

The department was seen mostly as unhelpful, a blocker, something to be worked around or generally ignored.

I joined the company from a much (much) larger organization. I joined because of the potential, because I'd worked with a lot of the people before (not just in IT), and because I was fed up of being a tiny cog in a massive machine. I was living in New York at the time, and the job was in Boston, however I was going so crazy at my old place that I decided to make the jump.

My schedule had me up at 5 on a Monday, on a plane from La Guardia just over an hour later. I'd put in a \~11 hour day, then head home with my boss (at the time) and spend Monday - Thursday staying with him and his wife, sleeping on a pull-out bed in an annex at the back of his barn. Thursday afternoon I'd schlep to the bus station and get a Greyhound back to New York, hop on the LIRR and be back home in Queens for between 11 and midnight, then WFH on the Friday.

I did this for about six months, (after three, I flew both ways) before my boss quit suddenly, our CISO became our CIO - and my new boss - as I stepped up into the IT Manager role, and moved to Boston.

By this time I'd already tried to make strides to improving the lay of the land. We moved our two-spreadsheet IAM to a custom-built Quickbase app, keeping track of staff, hardware, software licensing, and systems in use across the company.

We moved everything that supported SSO onto our Azure platform - aggressively - and put in Microsoft's SSPR tool to drastically cut down on the complexity of having usernames and passwords all over the show.

We implemented Autopilot to build Windows machines in a consistent and repeatable manner (this year we started on Jamf for the macOS side), and brought in sensible hardware standards.

Over a weekend my boss and I relocated our datacenter to a new Colo, cleaning up the cabling disaster, relocating hardware so that functions existed in the same racks, and saving about $1000 per rack per month in cost into the bargain. (This was a particularly stressful time, as we moved the Colo just before I moved house, a few days before I went to spend a week in the UK).  
We hired two more staff at this point, which has also helped enormously to distribute the load.

Most importantly (I think) we transformed the engagement with the rest of the company. I created a knowledgebase on Confluence (I think we're up to something like 200 pages of documentation now) and standardized processes across the board as much as we could. We ripped and replaced our terribly unreliable phone system and much maligned Webex setup with Zoom Meetings & Phone (also saving money in the process).

There's been a ton of other, smaller things, but I feel like those are the big ones that really helped get the house in order.

People can now just **get the job done** without worrying about tools that aren't fit for purpose, systems falling over, remembering one of 27 different passwords. Most importantly, they now trust that if something *does* go wrong, we'll be there to help them out and guide them through it, and they trust us to do so now.

We're still a long way off where we need to be, but at least now we know for sure that we're going in the right direction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gf9rb0/it_got_recognized_in_our_quarterly_awards_for_the/,IT got recognized in our quarterly awards for the first time ever,,1413,89,0.97

kg0anf,sysadmin,1608348486.0,"Rant/question: Is this situation as INSANE as it feels?

I am a 20 year old helpdesk intern at a company i’ve been with for 8 months. I have an associates in Systems Administration but my professors taught me nothing. I am working on a Security + cert and trying to teach myself other hard skills because I really only have basic troubleshooting and support knowledge. 
Brief overview of my usual activities:  troubleshooting, software support, and tons of documentation/project management. I do tons of things that go far beyond intern work (my boss even confirmed this) and have had to fit this work into my defined 20 hour work weeks. Long story short I started work in the very day our state shut down for COVID and they sent our 2 software developers home to work remotely. That left me, our sys admin, the other 20hr/week intern(we work opposite days) and the IT director left in the building. Well, as of today, they fired the sys admin (who was my direct boss), the other intern is leaving for another job and the director has had his responsibilities extended into a completely non-IT-related field leaving him unable to maintain his director responsibilities in full. This leaves me as the sole IT person in our whole building. It seems INSANE to fire the sys admin when none of the 3 of us left have sys admin knowledge/permissions or an appropriate salary to do this work. I went from being a helpdesk intern to a project manager, tech, helpdesk support specialist, software specialist and whatever other responsibilities I will have to absorb with NO PAY CHANGE but I am now full time. I already was overwhelmed with work creating policies, procedures and documentation for basic IT responsibilities that were just never established while maintaining our helpdesk. It was made clear in our meeting today that no pay raises will be given. 
Am I over-reacting or is this completely ridiculous????

Our department didn’t even know that Microsoft is retiring basic auth and we will have to be completely switched over by July to avoid complete chaos and lose access to Outlook.. We literally JUST finished setting up app passwords per user for 100 employees ... I was the one who caught it, had to write up the Epic, planning, and impact evaluation for it.. and now i’ll have to do it by myself along with everything else.

He had been trying to counsel the dude for a few months, knowing that he was having a rough time; a pending divorce, not seeing his 3 and 5 year old kids, a mountain of debt, some other personal issues, plus everything that an IT job burdens one with. We all go through shit, but unfortunately it was too much for this soul.

I myself have generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD, and I spent half of my life fighting the idea of therapy and meds. ""I'm strong enough to handle it"" was my war cry. I could have been that suicide if it weren't for my boss making therapy mandatory for me, on the company dime, bless her.

I won't advertise anything here, but that therapist has me on cognitive behavioral therapy and referred me to a psychiatrist who got me on a set of medications that, *oh my GOD*, help.

I think it's nuts to be in AA when you have 2-3 drinks per week, but hey, he says it helps him. Power to him, and you.

https://i.imgur.com/7kJTg7Q.jpg

As of this morning:

https://i.imgur.com/paQYO1f.jpg

How did I pull this off? Easy.  I have no fear.....and snapshots.  

I work in government so staffing was limited.  I was on vacation so I spent my evenings off performing FORTY in place upgrades.

FORTY.

Yeah that's right. Domain Controllers, SQL, Web Servers, DirectAccess nodes, on and on and on. One critical system after another. Some were 2008 servers that had to be upgraded to 2012 R2 then 2019.   You know how many issues arose from that? 

Zero. 

I say this because in-place upgrades are feared by the old timers I work with. They say it is a horrible idea in ALL circumstances.  I guess that's why when I started here in 2014 the file servers were Windows 2000 and several 03 and 08 boxes filling out the rest.    As of today we sit as an almost pure 2019 environment with a few servers getting outright decommissioned in a few months.  Then it'll be over.  Forever......until Server 2022 drops.  


Just do the in place upgrade. LoL.


EDIT: Loving the feedback. Even the ""you should be fired"" quotes. Amazing how some people will say that certain things won't work but here I sit with everything working following a Microsoft protocol known as the in place upgrade. *scary music plays*

Look fellas, I think MicroScrape has its faults.  However, I have had just as many issues if not more on fresh installs as I have doign in place upgrades.  It's 2020 out there.  Even they can improve and I'm here to tell you.  It'll probably work just fine.  Do your homework.  Know your environment. They don't allow in place upgrades because it's risky.  They allow it because they designed the OS and know how to allow the upgrade path.  Every issue that could arise from the upgrade could easily happen from a Windows Update.  Everything is a risk these days.  Don't stay on Server 2008. Please. It's end of life. Let it go.

Edit 2: I have about 450 towers in my environment that used to be Windows 7.....how do you think they got to 10?  Oh yeah.  A single line command to pull the iso from a network share and in place upgrade the PC. 50 a night for two weeks.  Hehehehehe

Edit 3: I had a request for more detail in my process. Here was my order of operations.  

Was it a new server that was born 2016? Yes? Upgrade.

No? Ok what's it running? Just a SQL server? Upgrade. 

Just a print or file server? Upgrade.  

App server? Ok is the app from the last 5 years?  Well that's all of em.  Upgrade. 

Domain Controller? Was previously 2012 R2.  In placed to 2016.  Technet article details how to in place to 2019. Upgrade.  

DirectAccess server?  Spiceworks forum posters/redditors say it went fine.  Others built new servers.  I've got snapshots.  Upgraded and tested.  We're good.  Next!

RDS? People say it blows it up.  I agree.  It sits at 2012.  

ADFS? NOPE. Blows that up also.  Stays 2016. 

Everything else?  Upgrade and test.  If your services are green and no errors you are good. If not revert snapshot and move on.  This happened exactly zero times.

Edit Final: Well I appreciate it guys.  What a nuke I set off.  Final thoughts.  

To those of you with an open mind, godspeed.  Progress starts with a small minority. 

To those who ""would have fired me"" for a successful deployment, I guarantee you are sitting somewhere where you can't fire anyone.  If you can, I hope your employees quit because you are the problem.  

Let's be clear.  This was Act 2.  Act 1 was 2008/12 to 2016.  3 years.  3 years with the most stable environment we've had in this joint.  You would have shunned me then.  Would it have changed anything?  No.  

I'm glad I was able to start a conversation.  Thanks to those who agree that in-place is safe.  Thanks to those to disagreed politely.  Screw you to those who are too high strung to look at anything another way.

I mucked around with it with no luck until I noticed one of the ports on his Ethernet switch was lit up constantly, it was super active. Unplugged it and the Internet was great, plugged it back in and the speed was crap again. Traced the run to a port in a bedroom, which was odd because the port had nothing plugged into it. Took the wall plate off and the wiring was weird - cable was a different color than the other end of the run and the wires were stranded rather than solid. Since the port wasn't being used I just unplugged it at the switch and left it. Problem solved!

8gzn3x,sysadmin,1525443984.0,"This keeps getting brought up by my supervisor. They used to be a radiology technologist. Hourly paid. You come in, check in the morning, do your work, then leave. Old school type person, but it blows my mind they can't see past that.

The supervisor keeps reprimanding us because we come in ""late"" or leave ""early"". Ignoring that they all want 8 hours of work on top of having us have unpaid call shifts, working after hours for projects, preventive maintenance, dealing with vendors that are in different time zones, and more.

I am the Head of IT and Infrastructure for a 50 person company. I have been with the business for about 6 years in various roles. It's owned by great folks who started it from scratch and built a really great work environment. The role I'm in now is my dream job; Tons of responsibility and the freedom to really spread my wings and make positive change.

I should mention, I have been putting in an insane amount of work planning, documenting, and overall solidifying the IT infrastructure and preparing for the next 5-10 years of company growth.

They had recently been asking me for a lot of information that sort of tipped me off (stuff like asset and software lists). Two days ago they announce to the whole company that they are being acquired, I found out with everyone else. After talking with them, they admitted they had not given any thought as to how the IT merge would happen and I am now left wondering if I will either be shitcanned an replaced by the purchasing company or demoted by default.

TLDR: Company being acquired, now I'm sulking about an uncertain future.

Friday afternoon I get a request to setup a new starter for Monday. So I create the user in ECP, add them to groups in AD etc, then instead of waiting 30 minutes for AD to sync with O365 I decided to go into AAD Sync and force one so I could get the user to show up in O365 admin and square everything off so HR could do what they needed.

I go into AAD sync config tool and use a guide from the previous engineer to force a sync (I had never forced one before). Long story short the documentation was outdated (from before the went to EOL) so when following it I unchecked group writeback and it broke everything and deleted ALL the users and groups.

To make things worse our pure Azure account for admin (.company.onmicrosoft.com) was the only account we could've used to try and fix this (as all other global admins were deleted), but it was not setup as a Global Admin for some reason so we couldn't even use that to login and see why everyone was unable to login and getting bouncebacks on emails.

My manager was just on the way out when all this happened and spent the next few hours trying to fix it. We had to go to our partner who provide our licenses and they were able to assign global admin to our admin account again and also mentioned how all of our users had been deleted. Everything was sorted and synced back up by Saturday afternoon but I messed up real bad 😭plan for the next week is to understand everything about how AAD sync works and not try to force one for the foreseeable future.

Today, sadly, is my last day as a systems administrator. Recently, my pluckly little employer was acquired by a large, well known 3-letter company that is mentioned here often (and never positively). 2019 was a gangbuster year for my plucky little company: yearly revenues increased 800% (!) from 2018, making it the best year in company history. After the acquisition was completed, our new parent company decided to reward us by laying off 10% of plucky company's workforce, including yours truly.

Honestly, it came as a bit of shock to me, because my performance was fine and my position cannot be eliminated. (It's part of a gold-plated contract with ridiculously high noncompliance penalties.) After I'm gone, they're going to fly my former teammates in every few weeks to keep the positioned filled. That's expensive and it's probably going to burn out my replacements, but I guess they figure that's ultimately cheaper than keeping me.

Nonetheless, I'm landing on my feet. Next week I'll be starting my new job as a python developer at a small cybersecurity firm. The pay is basically the same as my last job, it's very remote friendly, and my closest co-worker there will be a good friend from a previous job. It also puts professional development and cybersecurity experience on my resume, which is something I've been trying to get for a while.

All in all, I'm feeling a mix of bitterness at how I was thrown away, and optimism that I'll finally break out of the niche industry where I've spent most of my career, and the usual new-job nervousness. I won't miss the days spent on-call, and the severance [helps ease the pain too](https://giphy.com/gifs/94EQmVHkveNck).

axkibs,sysadmin,1551788153.0,"This is a response I wrote to a thread over at /r/ITManagers

I had a little fun writing it and thought you guys might like it.  It's not exhaustive by any means but I've been thinking about this for a little while and figured I should share.

&#x200B;

Original thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/avhjmz/18\_year\_old\_wants\_to\_become\_a\_manager/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/avhjmz/18_year_old_wants_to_become_a_manager/)

&#x200B;

Question:   Do you have any suggestions on how to improve my ""people"" skills and management skills? 

&#x200B;

My super long answer:

&#x200B;

1. Get better at talking to random people. I mean random. On the bus, in line at the movies, waiting to see a doctor etc.... just practice small talk with anyone who looks like they want to talk. More people are up for a chat with you than you think. Except that super hot girl at the bar, she will hurt you if you walk over.
2. Understand how to motivate people. Anyone you can motivate fear with doesn't count. Anyone can be scary. Think about the individuals your work with and think about specific strategies to motivate them.
3. Understand how to get things done with people who don't want to do them. Bribery is acceptable.
4. Spend time to look more professional. Step it up a notch or two, wear a tie, put on nicer shoes, wear a jacket, don't have blue hair. It makes you look like you care, and if you go buy a nice pair of shoes, or a fancy suit, you'll feel more confident because you know you look great.
5. Be prepared for your meeting and be on time for meetings. Take notes, have answers for questions you are likely to be asked. If you have an opportunity in meetings to present what you are doing, take that as an opportunity to sell yourself and your team. Do NOT look at your phone during meetings.
6. Build rapport with EVERYONE. If you don't go to lunch or drinks with people outside your direct team you're not doing it properly. And I mean at least once a week. Pick some lunch buddies or drinks buddies and just go. Don't be afraid to go for coffee in work hours. CEOs play golf on a Tuesday afternoon for a reason, and it's mostly not golf.
7. Always be more positive. Make people happy to talk to you because you always say something fun and awesome. Don't be that guy struggling. Ok, you can struggle, but if someone asks you how your day is going don't flatten the conversation with negativity. End with a positive note. ""Oh it's a long day, BUT I think I'm winning"" etc. If it's really bad, just flat out lie.
8. A lot of people will struggle to be good at talking to you, not because you are bad at it, but because they are bad at it. Some 55 year old senior manager who drives a Mercedes has 2 ex wives, 3 kids and a finance background, has no idea how to relate to a nerdy 18yr old (no offense). He just doesn't. But find out what he likes and ask him about that. I had a GM who played golf. What did we talk about in the break room.......golf. He doesn't really care, I don't care, but he knows I'll ask him and he can say something and we'll laugh about it and we wont feel awkward. My current go to conversations are golf, your kids and mine and Brooklyn 99. That list is in descending order of age (oldest to youngest)
9. Have an elevator pitch about what your doing at all times. ""Hey hows things goin'?"" If anyone reading this says ""same sh\*t different day"" I will b\*tch slap them. Stupid people say that. It's like saying ""someone's got a case of the Mondays"". Try your elevator pitch. ""Oh things are great (remember your positive), I'm working on the new <blank> project"". Boom! Now people know what you do all day and it sounds interesting.
10. Have difficult conversations and do it well. This is the hardest one. Saying No to people, telling someone they aren't doing a great job, or they aren't playing nice with others, or that your project is running late etc. Prepare what you are going to say. Roll play it in your head. The conversation will be different anyways but you will be prepared.
11. Don't have a meeting for something that could be in email. Don't write an email for something you can do over the phone. Don't call someone who works in the same building unless it's less than a minute conversation, go see them.
12. Over communicate. ""Hey just called to say I was working on your thing.""
13. My last tip is not entirely social, but become more solution focused than technology focused. What problem are you trying to solve? Fix it, and don't get hung up on the tech. Too many of us derail things with arguments over technology stacks or vendors or frameworks. IIS vs Apache? Esx vs HyperV? Who cares? Does the website look great and deliver what is supposed too? Does the virtual infrastructure work reliably? If the solution fixes the problem, then don't get too hung up on how it's being solved.

Most of these boil down to this: IT people feel like work gets done when we sit at a computer. Any time spent away from said computer is not productive or efficient or we are slacking off. That's somewhat true if your job consists of tasks on the computer. But now you are a becoming a people person, any time not spent with people is a waste.

So how do you know you are successfully becoming a people person? Random things will occur:

* You randomly talked to a lady in line at the bank about something other than the weather. It seemed natural and effortless.
* You end up on a Monday night trivia comp with some of the accounts team and Rachel from payroll.
* People reach out to you about something that's for your department but not really for you, because ""they know they should speak to Andrew about this, but he's a little weird and they'd prefer to talk to you about it"". On reflection you realise Andrew is a little bit weird.
* Rachael from payroll comments on your outfit.
* You say hi to someone by name in the large company you work at and someone else in your team asks ""How do you know them?""
* Your sales team starts to talk to you.
* You go for drinks with the entire finance team, no one else outside the finance team is invited. You and Rachael from payroll are the last ones at the bar
* The Head of HR makes coffee at the same time with you in the morning. You ask him about his cycling. You discuss the Tour de France that is coming up (you have no idea but just nod and agree with his opinions)
* Everyone on your floor buys you a card celebrating your engagement with Rachael from payroll. IT people are always excluded from office cards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/axkibs/my_tips_to_become_a_better_people_person/,My tips to become a better people person,X-Post,1383,271,0.93

So far:

* Largely automated new user creation.  That's my big project and even though I'll only use it a few times a year I'm getting *all* the skills.  Every thing that I think to add requires learning something new.  There are about 2 hours of clicking to get a new employee set up.  No more.  My third-party email team is even writing an API that I can hook into to create new accounts.

* Wrote a script that pulls files from our vendor's site and drops them in our accounting package.  One click updates.  This is what started it all.  Got sick of fussing with this every week.

* Tired of setting up Hyper-V server.  Took all my laboriously researched commands, dumped them in a script and polished it up.  Realized today that I can put the networking setup on the front end.  Even easier.

* Once a month a script gathers critical IT documentation, zips it and sends it to the president and VP.  Very paranoid something will happen to me and the next guy will be as screwed as I was.  C-levels are very appreciative.

My goal is to work myself out of a job and go around to other departments automating repetitive tasks.  Already helped Payroll greatly but I expect push-back from Accounting.  ""You don't understand!  We've always had to do this.  It's the only way!""
  
It's been made pretty clear this is my path to making a *lot* more money.  Again, management is very appreciative.  Finest people I've ever worked for.

u6jou8,sysadmin,1650305869.0,"Background:

I've been an IT manager for this company for a few years now.  When I started here I had two sysadmins under me who had both been here for over 10 years.  Due to rising ticket volume, a year after I started I managed to get a helpdesk tech added to the team.  During COVID in 2020 I lost one of my sysadmins because - despite his valid health issues and concerns - the company was forcing him to come back after working remotely for a time.  He was replaced with a junior sysadmin, and my other was given a promotion to senior sysadmin and about a 10% raise to retain him.  So now I have a HD tech, a junior sysadmin, and a senior sysadmin.

I hate working here.  My director is an idiot who needs everything explained to him 10 times before he thinks he has it, then goes off and poorly explains it to my executive director and CEO who then rejects the proposal, and I'm never allowed in those meetings.  My executive director left me hanging a couple years back while the CEO was shouting at me for doing something my exec director asked me to do.  The CEO is a tyrant and everyone is afraid of him.

I stayed for so long because it's been a really uncertain time for my wife and me.  A couple times we thought we were going to make an overseas move and I stuck around here because I thought there was an end in sight.  Then my wife got sick with a long-term illness and it's all been up in the air.  Now that we know what's happening in our lives, I've been looking to move on.

Now:

A month or so ago I was pretty far along in the interview process for a company, and I told my senior sysadmin.  He told me he figured I had been looking around, and told me that he'd started to do the same.  I was out sick for a couple weeks, and during that time my senior sysadmin told the junior and HD tech that he was looking to move on, and mentioned to me he'd done so.  When I got back I told them the same about myself.  They looked at each other, then said they'd had a conversation between them and that neither of them wanted to be here for the fallout if either me or my senior sysadmin left.  Me, because I'm the buffer between them and the madness of our administration, as well as a source of knowledge and help for them.  My senior sysadmin because he's been here for 15 years and has an absolute wealth of institutional knowledge.  

Short story:

I along with my senior and junior sysadmins and helpdesk technician are all looking to leave our 600+ employee org.  Soon.  I'm hopefully expecting an offer here in the next day or two.  The rest of them have my personal number and email, and permission to use me as a reference.

If you were me, you got there because all the porn you kept torrenting off Limewire. Nothing was worse than a family member logging in on our shared new fancy, gazillion dollar, computer back then talking about 'Error with file 18 year old whore blast her b-hole with Louisville slugger'. I'd be damned if that was a convo with my dad explaining that more than once, and even more damned if I missed out. When parents all got their kids computers in the 1990's / early 2000's, they didn't realize the internet was like a digital Vegas, except instead of herpes coming back with you, you'd come back with the ""I love you"" virues.

It might of been that copy of the Sims you wanted to play really bad and couldn't afford so you torrent it. It finally downloads, you go to activate it and it pukes DLL errors. Next thing you know you we learning what a registry was, DLLs, how to remove viruses. We didn't do this because 'if you know this you can get a high paying in demand job and live and be pretty set the rest of your life'. I did it because 13 year old me wanted to, burn houses down in my pirated version of SIMS, watch teen girls finger fuck themselves, and listen to Eminem rap about killing his ex wife in an MP3 I got off Napster that my parents would die if they heard. 

People would give anything to be skilled in high a demand and pays well. Don't take it for granted. We piss and moan but, at the end of the day, you don't get to the level we are at with 4 years of college. We all started learning our trade very very early. Most doctors didn't start learning things related to their field when they were our age. 

The only difference between me and the Starbucks Barista with a bachelors degree in Art is luck. I'm sure they were super passionate about Art, had drive, and loved it. Enough to the point that they took out 10's of thousands of dollars in loans.

Really.


The story: On the evening of the 4th of July, I went to bed, and started having strong pain in my left arm, was very short of breath, and felt my heart was racing. So, I was spirited to the hospital, where they measured a 240/180 blood pressure, and carted me right off to the heart catheter lab, where I got a stent. Two days of ICU, five more days of normal station, and then back home. A week later, rehab started (in a cardio rehab clinic right on the shore of a Bavarian lake with a view of the Alps, no less), where I'm still and will stay until mid August. Living in a country with sensible regulations around sick days and health insurance helps as well :)


My work (big big tech, I'm an architect in a customer operations team) behaved exemplary. I insisted to have a call with my team to tell them what's going on and to avoid dropping any balls I had in the air. In that meeting, they took their notes, and assured me everything is fine, all will be well, not to worry etc....


What happened then, however, was incredible. They sent me flowers (very nice ones), and when they got wind that my family was scheduled to move a few weeks later and I couldn't do anything, they got in contact with my wife, and on the day of the move a ten people delegation from work appeared, did all the schlepping, and painted the house top to bottom. This must have been the most expensive painting team far and wide :)
Also, I was told that when our VP got wind of the matter, he proclaimed this to be something like an officially sanctioned team event (so no one had to take a day off) and distributed a round of awards to the team. It went even as far as to the customer, who canceled all regular meetings for the day of the move because the team had more important things to do.


I'll be back at work in a few weeks, and will have been off for six weeks then.

I won't reveal my situation too much, but honestly the amount of hassle I deal with with end users syncing libraries and then they stop actually syncing and users actually lose work.

Recently had a user that ""lost"" a folder...my hands were absolutely tied, search was crap. Recycle bin almost useless, couldn't revert from a shadow copy or anything like that.

We have veeam backing it up but again couldn't search it easily.

The main concern is the seeming lack of control we have over one drive caching as opposed to offline files.

With a file server you can explicitly restrict users from caching folders/shares, so there is zero ambiguity as to when they are connected or not.

With SharePoint I've had users working happily for weeks, only to find none of it was being send to the cloud...data got lost because the device was wiped, even though the user said ""yes I save it in SharePoint - folder name"".

It was synced to file explorer but OneDrive for whatever reason had become unlinked and the user was essentially working 100% locally but there was ZERO indication and I only realised because the sync icons were missing...there needs to be a WARNING that it's not syncing...it needs to be better!

Also I've heard mention that a SharePoint site that is a few TB and maybe a million files is ""too much"" for it...fair enough but what's the solution then? I can tell you for certain a proper file server wouldn't have an issue with that amount.

Very little customer (she used to work for a bigger customer) asked us to setup a webserver for a website for her new consulting firm. We purchased a SSL certificate and got everything running (we didn't design the website - we only help her with a webserver, setting up the CMS, created users, installed the certificate  etc.).

Last week the owner send us an email: She had somehow found a website I'm not going to mention since they don't deserve to be named, but the sites name contains the word ""secure"" in Danish. On that website she had generated a report of a scan saying ***her*** website only scored 74% and asked us why her site wasn't secure?

I pointed out that the items in the report had nothing to do with security (first item on the list; her website does not support IPv6), and addressed this and 2 of the other 3 items on the list: You don't really have any need for IPv6, but if you want IPv6, it can be added, but it will be more expensive.

This week she wrote back, once again complaining about the security 'rating', stating she really didn't think she should pay for a website that isn't secure.

I went to the 'security' website in question and ran tests on two other websites (first two I could think of that she would know):

* Website of the Largest Bank in Denmark scored 52% (they're also not running IPv6)
* Google.com scored 66%

I wrote her back this evening, Ctrl-V'ed the results of the two tests in my reply, and explained to her, that she'd have to accept that the test said nothing about the security, or - based on the scores - that her site was 1.5 times as safe as the website of Denmark's largest bank.

**Edit**

Thanks guys for the support and offering your perspectives.  I want to clarify some things because I have to keep answering the same questions in the comments.  Yes, at my previous job I was paid for on-call work.  Generally I was paid time and a half for however many minutes I worked, or in 15 minute increments.  My argument is that we should be paid for the whole 168 hours of the week we are  on-call.. Not just the 40 regular hours plus time and a half for on call work.

I agree with everyone who says we need to unionize, and I think we can all benefit greatly from some transparency on other company’s On-Call procedures.



**Edit #2**

After tons of comments and discussions, I think I know the most reasonable way to approach this situation.  

1. Have a quarterly/monthly review of the amount of total hours worked from all employees on On-Call issues.

2.  Divide that amount by the amount of employees working the On-Call shifts.

3.  Multiply that amount by median hourly rate for your technicians/engineers, and then multiply it again by 1.5 to account for overtime pay.

4. Pay the fixed amount for the week the tech is On-call, plus the amount of total hours worked On-Call for the technician that week.


This encourages the business to fixed needs that keep arising after hours, and is also not saying flat-out “PAY ME FOR 168 HOURS A WEEK BECAUSE THIS JOB FUCKING INCONVENIENCED ME.”

gche63,sysadmin,1588466573.0,"I've been waffling on whether or not to post this, but in the past month, I received news that one of the contractors working on a project with me had passed away. This was after about 2 weeks of radio silence where we really weren't sure that had happened. Due to privacy concerns, I'm not sure what befell him, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. His name was common enough that checking obituaries hasn't really helped either. While I didn't know him all that well personally, I wanted to share how I knew him professionally. We'll call him Bill.

Bill joined the project a few months ago which entailed upgrading all of a client's Server 2008 machines and my role was as an advisor who knew the most about the client's environment. The project was described to him of just doing the engineering of performing the upgrades and maybe working with users or vendors, but the reality was much different. The client didn't know their environment well and it would fall to us to discover all their servers, validate the hardware, determine applications/function, confirm that with the application owner, plan out an upgrade path, and then perform the actual work. Despite a couple of grumbles, Bill took it in stride and took on a more leadership role without being asked.

He helped us come up with how we were going to document everything, assisted the other contractors, came up with email templates, always worked on improving processes, and setup a software repository with ISOs and installation media for us to work out of. He rolled out a slew of scripts and tools he had used on previous projects such as the MAP tool and was able to use that to help supplement the information that we did have. He helped clean up their AD by removing all old DCs/metadata, upgraded all existing DCs, cleaned up their RDS licensing infrastructure, actually setup a KMS server and corrected all of the wrong product keys, uplifted their domain functionality, and moved them to DFSR for replication. All of this really fell into a gray area as far as the scope of the project, but Bill knew the importance of having a healthy environment to go into and was all about best practices. Honestly, I'm not sure any of those things would have happened if it hadn't been for him and was in addition to all the upgrades and decommissions he performed. I was never concerned I'd have to double-check his work and really appreciated his help with the project.

Bill understandably had some frustrations that he expressed to me and I know it caused him some stress and anxiety. The client's environment and ""best practices"" can't be used in the same sentence which didn't sit well with him. A lot of the things you might take for granted just aren't in place and he was constantly hitting roadblocks. I did my best to commiserate and make sure that he knew I appreciated him, but I knew it bothered him just the same. I had grown used to and somewhat blind to it having worked with the client for so long.

I guess I just wanted to share how much I appreciated him. He was a man who took pride in his work, was always willing to help, and was always looking to improve things. My only hope is that this project wasn't a contributing factor to his passing. I wouldn't think that it was affecting him too bad, but I just can't be sure.

This community has been truly amazing. The help that so many of you have offered throughout the years. THe fact that /r/sysadmin has reports before the vendors. (Microsoft down? here will know first)

the shared venting. The mental support that so many of you have given.

From the very bottom of my heart, Thank you.

now for the story if anyone cares:

Been doing system administration of various sorts since my first IT job in 1996 when I was 16. IT / Computers were my passion. IN a world slow and offline, I saw a bright future where if we, the geeks of the 90's could get computers everywhere, and everyone on the emerging internet, the world would be a magical utopia (ha. ha... ha :()

Worked on and off (with some college) from then until 2010. Where I got into a software development company as system admin, Infrastructure and primary installation agent for all clients. I was one of only 4 people in the world who could install, support and maintain this proprietary banking back end.

What I didn't realize was the toll that would start to have on me. Banking industry is 24/7. There's no off. That's when the after hours calls started happening. Coming in. There was the expectation of anytime of the day, I could get called (And I sure did. 3am? drunk at a cottage and vacation? Tough shit, fix the probem for that client in Guernsey)

by 2017, I was in therapy for a mental breakdown. They laid me off.

in 2018, one of the clients found out I had been sacked and hired me on the spot. But they only had a helpdesk role at the time. I was desperate. Recovering from a breakdown and needed money. Up to that point in my career, I had never made more than 50k / year. And the new place started me there as well, so, I took it.. not knowing where it would go.

within 6 months, we were taken over by regulators, the rest of IT quit, leaving me, and the network admin alone. I ran with it. They promoted me to manager. Rebuilt the entire network infrastructure. entire aging server farm. rebuilt two datacenters, and then pivoted and managed to completely shift all users to Work from home, while dealing with Covid.

3 years now I've been doing this role as the sole IT Manager and System admin for a bank. with no backup to me. No staff with skills to admin. I hadn't taken a vacation in 2 years, and I felt myself reaching breaking point again and I said ""NO. I won't let that happen""

I resigned 3 weeks ago. Today is my last day as IT Manager and System administrator. I have no plans past today. I don't know what i'm doing next. And for the first time in my life, the idea of the unknown excites me instead of scares me.

So off I go into the sunset.

As a Full Stack ASP.NET Developer(platform Bing is Built on), I read this thread and saw a lot of blatant misinformation. I'd like to provide some advice on how to read network logs so that no one makes the same mistake.

OP posted an example of how Bing supposedly ""preloads related searches"":

https://i.imgur.com/lkSHswE.png

As you see above, OP searches for ""tacos"" on Bing Images, and then there seems to be a lot of requests for related queries, such as ""Chicken Tacos""

However, if you pay attention, you can clearly tell that those are not search queries, but rather, AJAX requests initiated by the page itself.

AJAX is basically a way for the client JavaScript to make requests to the server without reloading the page. This is how ""endless scrolling"" works, and also leads to faster, more responsive websites. It can also be used to load less important content such as images after the main page already loaded, improving UX.

Let's break down the urls, first by starting with the original search URL:

https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=tacos&form=HDRSC2

**/images/** tells ASP.NET to look for the images ""controller"" which is a C# or VB class containing 1 or more methods

**/search** tells the controller to run the ""Search"" public method.

**?q=tacos&form=HDRSC2** passes 2 parameters to the Search method. The first is obviously the query the user typed, the second doesn't really matter.

Next, let's look at the URL for one of the ""automatically ran related searches""

https://th.bing.com/th?q=Mexican+Chicken+Tacos&w=166&h=68&c=1&rs=1&pid=InlineBlock&mkt=en-US&adlt=moderate&t=1

**th.bing.com** First thing any sys admin should notice is this is an entirely different subdomain which should raise questions immediately.

**th?** it is calling the th controller at a completely different domain. Because no method is specified, it will run the index method

**q=Mexican+Chicken+Tacos&w=166&h=68&c=1&rs=1&pid=InlineBlock&mkt=en-US&adlt=moderate&t=1**

You can clearly see there are a LOT more parameters being passed here than the other query. Seeing **w=166&h=68** should be a hint that these are parameters for an image.

What is happening here is after you search for tacos, there is AJAX that runs and sends a request to Bing to load the preview image for the related search query(in this case, a Chicken Taco). The reason Microsoft does this instead of just loading everything at once is because by requesting images AFTER the page has loaded, the page can load quicker rather than the user having to wait for everything.

In this particular case, the subdomain should've been a dead giveaway that it wasn't a search. But in some cases it's even possible that AJAX requests can use the same path. Through something called ""overloading"", the same URL can run a completely different method based on how many parameters are supplied.

So what's the key takeaway here?

1.When viewing logs, pay attention to both the subdomain and the parameters passed to determine if the user actually actively navigated to a link, or if the request is a result of AJAX scripting.

2.The presence of a concerning phrase in a POST/GET request is not inherent proof that a user is engaging in that type of content. For example, if you accidentally hover over a Reddit username, it performs an AJAX request to:

https://www.reddit.com/user/Skilliard7/about.json

So if my username was something VERY NSFW, it would look like you were looking at a NSFW reddit user's profile, when in reality your mouse happened to pass over my username, but you never clicked it.

3.Bing is NOT automatically searching related searches, but they should stop recommending illegal search queries because it's just wrong

sl8v3o,sysadmin,1644073203.0,"On Monday I sent out a short email to everyone in my org informing them of an increased number of phishing attempts we are seeing that try to impersonate employees, and that I would be changing the color of the external message warning to a very visible red instead of the green it had been set to long before my time. I also told them to report any suspicious emails using the KnowBe4 Phish Alert button. 

One manager reported my own email back to me. She also started increasingly reporting random emails throughout the week. No big deal—better that she errs on the side of caution, right?

On Friday, I started a phishing campaign from KnowBe4 that impersonated an employee. It had the nice, big red external message warning, of course. That manager was the first one to click the link in the email and fail the campaign. 

But wait, it gets worse. 

She then receives an email (legitimate) notifying her that she had clicked a phishing campaign email and has been enrolled in remediation training. Guess what? She reports that email. 

I give annual in-personal trainings that everyone is required to attend. I also have various video training and exercises I send throughout the year. Heck, the very email I sent on Monday foreshadowed that this phishing email would be coming and how to address it, and she still failed.

I get that mistakes happen, but I am baffled.


Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments. I wasn’t quite looking for help (or criticisms) on how to handle failed phishing attempts—we have a policy with different levels of “coaching” for each offense, which is backed by HR 100%.

Chapter 1 & 2 will more than likely be skipped by many of you, but it was created to show the entire process from start to finish.

Edit: Added Chapter 5: Admin Training Documentation

Edit #2: Added Chapter 6: User Training Documentation

Edit #3: I overhauled a lot of the PowerShell scripts and added a PowerShell module. Chapter 4 has been updated to reflect said changes. I've also added the ability to utilize the Global Environments in BitWarden to Send Emails with said scripts. In other words, if you have Email working within BitWarden, there's nothing stopping you from using the Email Notifications within the scripts. I have examples of Cronjobs using Email notifications and demonstrate how to get Email working in your environment if you do not.

After 20+ years, we hit a cash flow pinch and our private equity group decided to write off their losses and close the doors. 200 families sent into a sudden tailspin. Check your emergency funds—I wish mine was a lot bigger right now. 

I’ve been here for 7 years, originally hired as a sys admin until my boss left. I was promoted to manager and then “director”, if you can use that title as a 1-man IT department. I’ve been responsible for all admin duties so I still lurk here through the years. 

They asked a few employees to stay on and help close the doors “the right way”. Finish billing transactions, collect what we can, sell what we can, archive databases for the shareholders, and more. But they were up front about not having a retention bonus to offer. I can’t even be 100% certain regular salary will be honored if this goes past a week or two... 

I don’t want to burn bridges with partners that will be hurt by our shutdown. They could be potential employers. If I stay I know I can help speed things up and maybe get enough cash back to see a bonus at the end. 

How many cases like this actually end up with the skeleton crew getting paid as they should? My job search will take priority during this period. I’m pretty confident the shareholders will be calling me whenever they need to access those databases again. But I didn’t believe they would pull this shit, so what do I know. 

About a new job: are you truly a director if you’ve been running IT for the whole company but with no subordinates? Ive had to struggle with imposter syndrome at times from being told I’m The Guy all the time, even though I just googled that magic solution two minutes ago. Even today as people were emotional and everything was under a cloud, they all would look at me and say, “Well you’ll have no problem finding your next job.” Or “My brother-in-law works for the bank but it’s probably below your pay.” Meanwhile I’m reeling inside. 

I‘m afraid when all of the responsibilities fall away, I’m still the same sys admin I was 7 years ago. Sure I’ve learned SQL & Powershell and can build reports, BI, even some C# and R programming. But enough to make a more specialized career change? Maybe not in this town. Who has been successful in doing that?  

It was stressful at times but I thought I had the perfect gig to learn and grow my skill set and I did in a major way. Now it’s time to prove it to a different company and I feel like I didn’t learn enough. 

Pad your emergency funds people.


**Edit for Update:** 

I really appreciate all of the messages and comments showing support and giving advice--especially offers for work. I have been blown away, so I thank you.

I am still at the office putting some time in, but the job search is #1. I have a few leads and a potential contract or two in the works, so I feel confident that I will be fine in the future.  One offer does involve a player in the industry who needs help to pick up the pieces, so I have no regrets about coming in the past few days and maintaining contact. There have been some tasks asked of me by this company that I've said ""No"" to. I'm doing some work here and there but they know there is a limit. 

My emergency fund will be good for a little while, and I have family support if I need it. I just wish the fund was secure enough to where I never have to ask for that help; and I hoped this would scare some of you to reevaluate where you stood. There were 200 families here that needed to be prepared for this scenario and sadly most were not. If you aren't prepared then you need to be.

The odds of getting paid for this week do look a lot better. They extended insurance for the few of us remaining through the end of November. They are looking at PTO numbers to see what it'd take to pay outstanding time off for all employees. I'll know for certain early next week. But without a doubt, once there's a sign that the paycheck isn't coming or isn't complete, then I can do the job search from home. All of the suggestions to go for unemployment sound valid, but it feels like the extra month of insurance may balance out that delay considering what COBRA will cost for my family. 

A lot of people have mentioned the WARN act and whether the owners may be violating it with the massive layoff. (I am in the Southeast US, by the way.) I've only browsed the wiki page, but this exception looks like it would get them off the hook:

> The WARN Act is not activated when a covered employer: 
 If a plant closing or a mass layoff results in fewer than 50 workers losing their jobs at a single employment site  


We only have 20 people in our headquarters. The rest are all sales and operations spread out in satellite offices or working from homes and vehicles across a dozen states. It is interesting that they made a point on the language to tell people we have not yet shut down and we are not filing for bankruptcy. Instead we have ""ceased operations"" while they lay off 195 people, and we'll shut down later. I don't know how they avoid bankruptcy after that, but they want to be sure people don't think we are doing it now.

Lastly someone asked about warning signs. We had made a strategic shift that definitely left us vulnerable to the kind of wall we hit when it came to cash, but no one thought the rug would be pulled out so suddenly. The investors were in to sell the company and that was no secret from the day I was hired; the shift was to get us on that path with a partner company who would become the buyer. But even though there was a dispute with the partner and cash was held up as a result, we assumed they were both invested enough to figure out a path forward. Turns out they weren't. It's still a shock at how abruptly it ended. Our customer base alone was valuable enough to attempt a hand-off to somebody. Instead they got screwed too and it's a free-for-all as they scramble for new solutions. Not to mention the assets that are now sprawled across a quarter of the country and no employees available to collect any of it.

In retrospect the rumblings were there, but the transition was going to be hard so it felt like part of the deal. And there were plenty of other signs that told us it was business as usual and there was a plan for the future. The benefit of staying on and seeing it through to the end outweighed any quiet concerns I had. Just wasn't quite the end that I imagined.

Anyway, I'm looking positive overall. Losing some sleep, sure, but there's nothing to do but to move ahead. My old boss who mentored me here told me this will be the hardest job I ever did and whatever's next will feel like such a relief. I'll take some relief right now, but a part of me doesn't want it all to be easy from here.  
For the past year I've been taking classes for Data Science out of curiosity, and while I know I've had to sacrifice some expertise by being the JOAT guy in a 1-man shop, the idea of being able to define your next job so that it focuses on the interesting parts of what you do now is pretty awesome.

Presented by the guy who made the decision to force the TPM requirement. Since it's supposed to be Read Only Friday today, I think it's a good watch IMO for all WinAdmins. Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it's their goal.

A few key things mentioned;

- Enforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. 

- By default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. 

- App control designed to avoid 'dialogue fatigue' like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won't have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.

- Elaborates on the 'Microsoft Pluton' project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM's handle TPM standards themselves.

- Working with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn't required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.

- Scrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.

- Explains how they're planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too). Demonstrates with Notepad++

- Discusses how they're planning to target token theft issues with OAuth.

There is no amount of money that will make me help you. I do not want to fix your computer, I am not going to fix your computer. I do not care what the issue is, find someone else""

Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?

I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.

The site managers response was ""well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1114113/im_a_sysadmin_im_43_and_ive_just_been_diagnosed/

I read through the post and the comments and found myself relating to almost everyone who talked about their ADHD and diagnosis. I had suspected ADHD for probably a decade, but to me ADHD was just the guy who can't sit still and is a disruption to everyone around them, which wasn't me. But what I didn't know was that my ADHD burnout had been slowly boiling and was at a point where I couldn't contain it any longer.

https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-burnout

My ADHD was my brain constantly telling me that I needed more dopamine. Every waking hour of the day was spent needing to force myself to stay on task and stay motivated. Having kids sent that burnout into overdrive because then I had almost no time to myself to actually get that dopamine. 

I was anxious about everything, kids, money, work, everything. It had gotten to the point where I didn't want to make updates or changes at work because I was afraid that something might break and I'd be on the hook to fix things. And yet...if things DID break the anxiety would leave and I would be so hyper focused that I would recover us from an AD Tombstone issue and realize that it had been 10 hours and I was starving because I hadn't eaten yet.

I had a short fuse with my wife and kids because my anxiety and frustration levels were at a constant 6, so any little thing would push me over the edge. Frustrations and arguments/fights would stick to me like glue for a day or 2, like a dark cloud was just following me everywhere I went.

Constant negative thoughts. Almost every night as I was getting ready for bed I would think to myself, ""Is this just what life as an adult is? Never being happy and just slogging through the days?"".

Never ever feeling like I was awake and alert, even though I was up to the caffeine equivalent of 3 or 4 energy drinks EVERY DAY. Caffeine never made me anxious or jittery, for decades it just made me feel normal, and like I could function. I would get 8 hours of sleep and wake up feeling like I got 3 hours. I would be absolutely dragging ASS by 8pm every single day as well.

I filled out the self-assessment form (https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf) and was shocked at how much of a strong indicator of ADHD it showed. I sent a MyChart message to my GP with the assessment form and an explanation of how I felt.

Had a meeting with my GP a few days later, got a script for vyvanse, and it got filled...but it was going to be $239. I decided that was too much money and I wasn't going to do it. But then that weekend was absolutely terrible for me mentally and emotionally. I don't even remember what happened, but I was just worn out and defeated, to the point where I thought, ""eff it. I'll troubleshoot this by just trying it and see where we go from here.""

When I tell you that I felt a difference from day 1, know that I am not exaggerating. The difference in my brain having the dopamine it needs has been absolutely life-changing for me. To the point that on day 3 I almost cried with relief when I realized that this could actually be my life from now on. I would find a way to pay $500 a month to have the relief that I feel now (but insurance and savings card brought it down to $92 a month, so it's even better.)

I feel well-rested after 7 hours of sleep. My therapist had actually suggested talking to my GP about an anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant, but there is absolutely no need for either of them now. I have spent more time ACTUALLY engaged with my kids (instead of constantly fighting my brain to go do something more interesting) in the last 4 months than in the previous year. I had a YT Music work playlist to keep my focused that I would listen to every day, and I haven't listened to it more than a handful of times in 4 months. I can complete tasks around the house and my car, home office, and bedroom are cleaner than they've consistently been for the last decade+. My passion for IT is back to levels it hasn't been in a long time and I've implemented more things at work in 4 months that probably in the previous year and a half because I'm not crippled with anxiety.

Don't ignore your burnout, or your symptoms. For years I would read about burnout and my thought would be, ""I mean, what's the big deal....you just put one foot in front of the other and get stuff done.""
