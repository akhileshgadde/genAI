jndnvu,Velocloud,1604421734.0,"Howdy folks,

Forgive my ignorance, while I know enough to setup a decent home network, I'm afraid I'm a bit out of my league when it comes to more complicated network solutions.  My company is going to be implementing Velocloud network devices as we have transitioned many of our employees to work from home.  Being as I work for a hospital, security and privacy are important.  However my wife is a teacher and is also working from home intermittently and requires a certain level security to protect student privacy.

My Current setup is simple with a Modem and a separate router providing both wired, and wireless connectivity.  If I connect the Velocloud device to the router will that device maintain an isolated connection to my work's WAN and be unable to connect to (or be connected to) any other device on my home network?  Basically I just want to make sure that patient data on my work PC can't be compromised if somehow one of my home PCs or other devices becomes compromised (not that I'm planning to let that happen).

Basically I want to ensure that the Velocloud will leave my home network alone save for providing a connection to my work's WAN for only those devices connected to the Velocloud device.

As a follow up, if my wife's school district decides to implement something similar, can two of these kinds of devices be connected to the same router/modem without interfering with each other, even though they are now providing connections to two different WANs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Velocloud/comments/jndnvu/privacy_questions_regarding_velocloud/,Privacy questions regarding Velocloud,,2,6,1.0

We have a VeloCloud 520 positioned between the incoming ISP connection and our own firewall/router. We keep losing internet a few times a day. Each time it is out for 5-10 minutes. 

The ISP is showing their hardware has been up throughout these outages. A third party provider manages the VeloCloud, and they are showing power loss to the VeloCloud. Each time it goes out, it always comes back up as if it initiated a reboot. The internet always gets restored, but the outage is more annoying than anything. 

We have moved the VeloCloud and ISP hardware from a UPS battery backup to separate outlets for testing. We changed all Ethernet cables attached to the VeloCloud. We replaced the ISP hardware, and replaced the VeloCloud. The problem has persisted throughout this. The same thing is happening each time.

I want nothing between these with the VCEs locked firm to the IP addresses of the branches relying on the VCO registration and endpoint acls securing the tunnel. 

The current standard this is replacing is Cisco router to router over mpls with the traffic filtered at the dc post edge leaves. That is the security approved standard for our non-pci required compliance.  We also have some branches on ipsec tunnels that land in a vpn firewall to the edge leaves. 

Now however the security manager wants to place the backend asa in path between the VCEs even though it’s encapsulated and tighter security. His argument is this is inet versus mpls but we are only allowing tunnels from know endpoint IPs that have to be know serial/Mac addresses in the VCO.

The Active Velo Edge green led goes white and the PE Router becomes unresponsive. Cannot SSH into it anymore. It stays like this until I remove the cable from PE Router.

\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*Hello all, I should have been more clear in my post but after looking at the questions commonly asked, let me update it here.

Why Choose E-HA :Company choose it before I joined it. So its now a standard. However many people are under the impression that the E-HA works when you have 1 uplink from each veloedge(active + Standby). While this is true, we can also have a common uplink that will connect with both velo edges. This is possible and we have been doing it for larger sites. So it will be like this

Active Velo Edge:  
Port X : Internet/Uplink  A  
Port Y : Internet/Uplink B 

Standby Velo Edge:  
Port Y : Internet/Uplink B  
 Port Z : Internet/Uplink C

The benefit is HA link  will only be used for Port Z tunnel/traffic since we have limitation of bandwidth on HA link depending on model/specs.

Resolution: At this site, the MPLS connection is based on 4G. The 4G MPLS router is up but do not have enough signal strength. When a velo edge connects to orchestrator & tunnels created, it automatically does the speedtest. At this stage, the 4G router (cellular interface esp)  goes down since I believe it is not able to handle the amount of traffic. The primary veloege LED goes amber where it tries to reach to hub/orchestrator. I am in a process of getting an external antenna for the site & hoping it will resolve this issue.

I am using 680s for this site. I hope I have answered all of your questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Velocloud/comments/wqqi43/velocloud_enhanced_ha_issue/,VeloCloud Enhanced HA - Issue,,1,8,1.0

This question would have been asked already, but I did not find anything about it online.

How do you activate VeloCloud Edge in a MPLS only branch site with no internet link?

Do we have to provision the edge first in the VCO, configure Edge specific settings by creating user-defined overlay, enable Service Reachability in the WAN settings, and then send the activation email along with configuration to the site contact?

because the normal approach shows an ""VeloCloud Orchestrator Unreachable"" error during activation.

 

* The VCO is cloud hosted.
* VC Edge at data center has hybrid links and are configured as Hub device. It backhauls the Gateway and Orchestrator services for the other edges.
* At another MPLS only site, earlier they had used internet to activate the edge and later removed the internet link.
* This is a new edge that will be joined to the network (MPLS only site).
* I wanted to know how do we activate the VeloCloud Edge without Internet.

Does anyone knows the convergence time after a failure on the active device in standard HA configuration.  


I was testing on my Lab environment, I shutdown the active device triggering a fail-over thus the secondary device took the active role.  
I recover the communication  after 1 minute, I was pinging the LAN interface of the VCE and I lost 15 pings on the windows command line.

Is there a VCO & gateway 4.4.0 planned? Or is this an end of “regular” vco/gateways, and is the SASE stuff to take over.

om4xa6,Velocloud,1626530848.0,"Hi, i’m curious who has experience with using api (only) based on provided swagger specfile and would like to share information. Hope we can learn and improve.

We’re using openapi and velocloud swagger to generate go library we use in our custom written terraform provider.
We build some experience with that (and using it) but also lots of issues due to incomplete swagger specfile & openapi generation issues (looks not a features are fully supported)


I’m interested in your experiences using api (only) but share a bit experience of my own as well.


As it seems the vco is NOT based on the specfile, but looks like swagger specfile is generated afterwards and swagger specfile is not corrrect/complete etc. Noticed wrong/inconsistent datatypes, missing items, missing api call definitions, empty definitions and even a circular definition…etc.

With velocloud api team it feels like no great enthusiasm ( big big understatement) to actually fix things (swiftly). Need to push for ticket id after reporting issue (and fix). But no way to track these yourself, never feedback when fixed (if fixed at all)…enough said…you get the point….

The apiv2  looks promising, but may take many years  to fully complete (estimated on progress i see, i estimate morel likely 5 years then the 1 year they announce).
So we can’t wait for that.

So what is your experience?
Can/do you use api only to manage all resources?
Do you generate library from specfile?
What tooling you use to generate library to be used in your mngt software
What do you think of spec file (after actually using it) (quality/usability)
Do you manage all resources based on api fully from specfile? 
Do you need to reverse engineer the api from vco all the time? (As opposed reading/using specfile)
Do you manage resources from desired state (from git)?
Do you manage resource and not keep track of state? (For example deploy an edge in manual created profile, and manage by hand after that)
Anyone has experience/opinion on the many cross referencing to other objects used, and  quality on how that is documented?
Any experience/opinion on resources which id’s are generated in vco after deployment, but need that id to deploy. (Circular dependency, no way to straight one go deployment)
What is your experience when reporting api issues, like incomplete, missing, inconsistent . … definitions in swagger specfile?
If you entirely trust on api (swagger specfile), what kind of business you’re in (small/middle/enterprise) ?

Like to hear from you.

lgekz2,Velocloud,1612907833.0,"We have about 100 locations on Velocloud.  We are rolling out new timeclocks that have an odd behavior in that they exchange punch information amongst all the other clocks when people are punching in and out (so several times a day). This is all done using the **internal** IP addresses (timeclock to timeclock).

This causes tunnel spikes, and we get warnings in our logs that the tunnel capacity has been exceeded due to the creation of a bunch of Edge-to-Edge tunnels during this exchange.   Granted, this only lasts for a few minutes (tunnels are torn down afterwards), but it bugs me.

I have identified the traffic and know the destination TCP port number used for this transmission (with the typical random high port on source), and the transmissions are tiny at a few kilobytes so available bandwidth isn't a concern.

I'm considering creating a Business Policy rule that shunts this specific traffic via the Gateway (via Multi-Path rule) to prevent all these spurious Edge-to-Edge tunnels.  Basically:

Source: [10.0.0.0/8](https://10.0.0.0/8) any port

Dest: [10.0.0.0/8](https://10.0.0.0/8) on the specific TCP port

Action: Multi-Path

Note that I have some Multi-Path rules for Internet-bound traffic, but I've never used one for on-net (overlay) bound traffic.

Questions:

1. If I send traffic destined for an internal IP address via the Gateway, will the traffic stay on-net (e.g. via overlay?  I assume the answer to this is ""yes"" since I understand the Edge will use the Gateway when tunnels are maxed out.
2. Do I need a second rule for the return traffic as well?  In other words, a second rule sending traffic *sourcing* from the TCP port to any port via Multi-Path too?
